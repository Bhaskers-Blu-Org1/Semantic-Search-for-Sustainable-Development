LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT

This development strategy, the Agenda for Transformation (AfT), is an important step toward fulfilling our government's commitment to lift Liberians out of poverty to prosperity. The Agenda for Transformation, our medium term development strategy, is a major paradigm shift in the history of Liberia's development. Over the past several years, our national development agenda has been confronted by unforeseen circumstances which have required us to think harder, develop new ideas, and take deliberate actions. The Lift Liberia Poverty Reduction Strategy, spanning 2008-2011, placed Liberia on the path of recovery. Under this strategy, we have seen big, tangible gains in the areas of peace, national security, stability and infrastructure development, among others. The onus is now on all of us to consolidate these gains, extend the impact to ordinary citizens in our towns and villages and situate the country on the path of economic transformation and inclusive growth.

This is what the Agenda for Transformation is all about. The Agenda for Transformation was developed through a country-wide participatory process involving consultations in 154 districts of Liberia. Students, youth leaders, business communities, women's organizations, persons with disabilities, religious and traditional leaders, farmers, teachers, health workers, and local community opinion leaders participated in these district-level discussions.

During these consultations, Liberians appreciated the bottom to top approach of national development planning and spoke to rebuilding Liberia on the foundation of equality and respect for individual rights and dignity. Liberians expressed their aspirations for a reconciled society, in which each Liberian can access quality education, basic health care, and critical infrastructure, all of which would help Liberia achieve a higher standard of living.

This Agenda prioritizes the expectations and aspirations of our people expressed at those county-wide consultative meetings. Throughout this Agenda, we focus on creating more jobs, building infrastructure, generating energy, and improving the quality of life by spreading the benefits of growth to all our citizens. We prioritize the provision of basic skills to our young people to enhance their productivity for nation- and state-building. We pursue national healing and reconciliation and an open, transparent, and accountable democracy that will ensure political stability.

The Agenda for Transformation in itself will not-in the next five-year timeframe-be able to achieve all that Liberia is poised to do. Instead, it is the first step toward achieving the goals set out in Liberia RISING 2030, Liberia's long-term vision of socio-economic and political transformation and development. The Agenda sets out specific goals and objectives that Liberia must achieve in the next five years, moving toward a more prosperous and inclusive society. The Agenda for Transformation is consistent with the principles of the Paris Declaration, the Accra Agenda for Action and the New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States.

While it represents an essential step in our nation's long-term development, the Agenda is meaningless if it is not backed by concerted actions. This is not just another document to be placed on the mantelpiece; it must be seen as a living framework for meeting Liberians' expectations for social and economic development, sustained and accelerated growth. The challenge is to ensure that expectations arising from the consultations are met in a timely and comprehensive manner. The call for a combined effort of government, civil society, private sector, and the Liberian citizenry has never been louder. Failure to deliver on the expectations contained in this Agenda is not an option. Our success depends on consistent planning, effective coordination, robust implementation, prudent and efficient use of resources, and most importantly, a collective will to succeed. The Liberian Government, for its part, remains committed to making the reforms required to fulfill our people's vision for development: attracting foreign investment to create more jobs, promoting balanced growth countrywide.

As a Government, our sincere thanks go to all the participants in the Agenda's preparation: local county officials, civil society organizations, private sector actors, legislators, and all ministries, agencies, and commissions, especially the Ministry of Planning and Economic Affairs.

Finally, we thank our development partners, who provided both financial and technical support to the entire process. In implementing this Agenda, we look forward to their continued collaboration to achieve the objective of transforming Liberia. I call on all Liberians, both in the country and in the Diaspora, to seize the opportunities the Agenda provides to make our collective dream a reality.

Ellen Johnson Sirleaf President, Republic of Liberia

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Agenda for Transformation (AfT) is the Government of Liberia's five-year development strategy. It follows the three-year (2008-2011) Lift Liberia Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS), which transitioned Liberia from post-conflict emergency reconstruction to economic recovery. The AfT will not deliver transformation by the end of the next five years. . Rather, it is the first step toward achieving the goals set out in Liberia RISING 2030, Liberia's long-term vision of socio-economic transformation and development. The AfT articulates precise goals and objectives and corresponding interventions that move Liberia closer toward structural economic transformation, prosperity and inclusive growth.

Ultimately, the success of the AfT will entail making hard choices and taking deliberate and bold steps to ensure that resources are directed towards priority areas and interventions. Aid resources are particularly important in this regard, since AfT financing will rely heavily on funding from development partners. It is expected that aid flows to the AfT will be consistent with the Paris Declaration, the Accra Agenda for Action and the New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States.

The structure of the AfT is as follows: Chapters 1 and 2 highlight the history from which Liberia has emerged, the work that has been done in the reconstruction phase, and the vision of where Liberia is heading. Chapter 3 presents an overview of the geography, population, and poverty in Liberia. Chapter 4 discusses the global and regional trends and the potential opportunities and risks that they pose to Liberia's development agenda.

Chapter 5 outlines the process of developing this strategy; its relation to other strategic plans, including Vision 2030; and the collaborative process from which it emerged. Chapter 6 looks at the accomplishments and lessons learned from the predecessor strategy to the AfT, the first PRS of Liberia. Informed by the lessons of the past, Chapter 6 also outlines key principles that are internalized in the AfT and in its strategic choices. Chapter 7 describes the objectives and the structure of the AfT.

Chapters 8 through 12 constitute the main strategy itself. They describe the specific goals and objectives across five pillars that Liberia plans to achieve in the next five years, and the binding constraints to growth that need to be unlocked. Chapters 13 and 14 discuss the costing of the priority interventions in the AfT, the macroeconomic policy framework and implementation strategy, respectively. Chapter 15 discusses its monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework, and Chapter 16 concludes with a description of the risks to realization of the strategy, and plans to mitigate those risks.

SECTION I: HISTORY, CURRENT CONTEXT, AND THE NATIONAL VISION

CHAPTER 1.

FROM RECOVERY TO INCLUSIVE GROWTH AND

WEALTH CREATION

1.1 INTRODUCTION

Liberia is certainly on the rise. Since 2003, the country has enjoyed peace, two democratic elections, and nearly a decade of economic recovery. During this time, the Government of Liberia (GoL) and Development Partners (DPs) have remained committed to strengthening recovery and reconstruction and to translating the benefits of peace to ordinary Liberians. Several short- and medium-term development plans have since been implemented. The GoL's 150-Day Action Plan of 2006 provided the first glimmer of hope to war-battered Liberians that the newly democratically elected government would protect basic rights and restore vital social services. The 150-Day Action Plan and subsequent plans were a precursor to subsequent plans, such as the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy of 2007 and the complete Lift Liberia Poverty Reduction Strategy of 2008-2011. These strategies and plans provided stimulus to an already struggling and weak economy, strengthened the rule of law and significantly improved the national security environment, widened the reach and impact of government services, especially in healthcare and education, rehabilitated some infrastructure and generally reduced the punishing burden of poverty for many Liberians. Today's images of crops growing in replanted fields; traders hawking wares in the bustling markets of Monrovia; cars immobilized by thick traffic snarls; uniform-clad children rushing to school-are clear, visible signs that economic recovery has taken hold.

However, descent into conflict occasioned far more significant damage to infrastructure and institutions than the gains from the period of recovery have been able to resolve. The path from recovery to prosperity demands a greater quantity of public investment than has been possible so far. By United Nation's Human Development Index, Liberia still remains one of the poorest countries in the world. Significant stretches of the already struggling rural agrarian economy is cut off from urban Liberia during the raining season due to inaccessible, impassable primary roads. Despite sustained GDP growth in the recovery period, unemployment remains high, especially among the country's youthful population. Many of these challenges require more long-term strategic interventions which the Government of Liberia now aims to deliver through the Agenda for Transformation. Thus the AfT now effectively becomes the roadmap to take Liberia from recovery toward middle income country status by 2030.

This chapter reviews the historical issues of growth and inequality that fueled the conflict in Liberia. It then discusses the progress that Liberia has made in establishing the foundations for more inclusive growth during its recovery and reconstruction phase with the help of the Lift Liberia PRS. It further summarizes the binding constraints to inclusive growth and wealth creation that remain to be addressed by the AfT.

1.2 HISTORICAL ISSUES AROUND GROWTH AND INEQUALITY IN LIBERIA

By 2013, Liberia will have crossed the 10-year milestone within which post-conflict countries face an omnipresent threat (50 percent chance) of relapsing into violent conflict.1 To permanently move beyond that threat, Liberia's growth and development must be seen to be widely shared, with its benefits spread across the population. Liberia is determined not to repeat the mistakes of its past, when income inequality and socio-political marginalization fueled a brutal conflict that shook the nation for 14 years.

In the decades preceding the start of instability in the late 1970s, Liberia's growth record was remarkable. The country had grown at an average rate of more than 7 percent annually during 1955-1975. By 1980, Liberia's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita peaked at US$1,765 (purchasing power parity, constant terms), bringing the country close to the middle-income threshold. Despite eight years of strong growth since the peace settlement, today's average level of GDP per capita is only US$310-still well below that historical peak. However, that early growth had been driven by a number of isolated sectors. By the early 1970s, iron ore accounted for more than half of Liberia's export earnings; rubber and other cash crops accounted for 15 percent of all value added.2

While this growth delivered results on top-line statistics, it also masked serious problems of poverty and inequality in much of the country. In 1970, less than 20 percent of the labor force was employed in the formal modern sector, while 74 percent was employed in low-productivity agriculture. Concessions employed only 7 percent of workers, despite their large share in GDP and exports. Wage inequalities across the sectors were stark: in 1974, per capita GDP in the agricultural economy was less than US$120 per year, compared to almost US$900 in the cash-crop economy and an estimated US$2,500 in the concessions sector.3 A mere 3.9 percent of the population controlled more than 60 percent of income, and a large share of the benefits from enclave sectors was repatriated by foreign investors. Human capital levels were extremely low, with only 25 percent of the labor force (above age 15) literate. The average level of educational achievement in the country as a whole was only 1.3 years.

By the 1970s, the GoL was trying to counteract these trends, but the efforts were too little, too late. With the global decline in commodity prices during the late 1970s, expected revenue flows from natural resource rents failed to materialize, and the government's fiscal position deteriorated. Liberia began a long-term economic decline, which was exacerbated by a subsequent military coup and ultimately outright civil conflict (Figure 1.1). Following the signing of the 2003 peace agreement, the country has grown steadily and boasts significant opportunities for growth, with well-managed reactivation of the iron ore and cash crop sectors and prospects for the discovery of commercial quantities of oil. The prospect of Liberia reaching middle-income status is becoming a reality once again.

However, Liberia has learned from its recent history that economic growth is necessary but not sufficient; that growth must lead to both structural transformation and economic diversification; must generate productive formal sector employment for a large number of citizens; and must be the 'rising tide that lifts all Liberian boats'. These lessons are recognized in the Lift Liberia PRS, which aimed to revitalize the traditional resource sector - iron ore, rubber and timber - to begin the process of structuring the foundation for sustainable and inclusive growth. The first PRS sought to achieve specific objectives in four broad areas: expanding peace and security; revitalizing the economy; strengthening governance and the rule of law; and rehabilitating infrastructure and delivering basic services. Significant achievements were made in each of these areas, which have created the foundations for growth on which the AfT will continue to build.

1.3 ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE RECOVERY PHASE-THE FOUNDATIONS FOR INCLUSIVE GROWTH

Starting from a state of post-conflict instability, weak state institutions, and an economy left in shambles by nearly two decades of violence, the Lift Liberia PRS achieved significant successes and reforms. Perhaps one of the most critical achievements has been the maintenance of peace and security. Following 17 years of war, Liberians have been able to achieve a level of reconciliation that has allowed society to function peacefully. Furthermore, two relatively peaceful, democratic elections have been held (2005 and 2011). This success reflects hard work on the part of the citizens, as well the Government's actions to strengthen social cohesion; build capacities to manage tension without outbreaks of violence; promote reconciliation; and gradually lessen political polarization. As part of the PRS, Liberian security institutions, primarily the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) and the Liberia National Police (LNP), were rebuilt and reformed into professional and capable institutions. Although challenges remain and Liberia continues to rely on the support of a large force of United Nations peacekeepers, the country will assume

full responsibility for maintenance of security over the coming years. This peace and security has allowed Liberians to return to their farms, start businesses, return to their country from abroad, and witness the surge in flows of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to Liberia.

To revitalize the economy, the three-pronged economic strategy of the PRS focused on (i) rebuilding critical infrastructure; (ii) reviving traditional resource sectors; and (iii) establishing a competitive business environment. Initial actions in these areas have set the stage for near-term growth. Infrastructure and basic services saw more than US$500 million of direct investment, with key components of infrastructure (including airports, ports, and roads) renovated or reconstructed. During the PRS, nearly 2,500 kilometers of paved and laterite roads were reconstructed or rehabilitated; electrical generation capacity increased from practically zero to 23 megawatt (MW); 48 kilometers of power transmission and distribution lines were constructed or renewed; and implementation began on the regional West Africa Power Pool (WAPP) cross-border electrification project. To revive traditional economic sectors, Liberia attracted leading global firms that have begun to reinvest in forestry, rubber, and mining. As a result, exports have increased from US$175 million in 2006 to US$295.2 million in 2011. In addition, Liberia has attracted foreign direct investment (FDI) in several non-traditional sectors including petroleum, oil palm, hotels, finance, industry, and infrastructure. In total, FDI is poised to reach roughly US$16 billion and create more than 100,000 jobs over the next several years.

However, these investments alone will not be sufficient to diversify the Liberian economy, nor create jobs for the roughly 500,000 Liberians who will graduate from secondary and post secondary institutions in the next 5 to 10 years. Therefore, the Government has worked out a plan to establish a competitive business environment for firms in Liberia. It has reformed the Tax Code and the Investment Code, making them more competitive and beneficial to growth. It has streamlined business registration processes; established a one-stop-shop for customs clearing; and started implementing proactive industrial policies as a way of facilitating the growth of local micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMES). The Government also made it a priority to achieve a stable macroeconomic environment, which is necessary for growth. Further, it maintained a cash-based balanced budget; significantly increased government revenue; moved toward multi-year financial planning; and achieved US$4.9 billion of cumulative debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. These and follow-up actions are creating the right incentives for further growth in employment, GDP, and public and private investment.

The Government has also focused strong efforts on improving governance, strengthening justice, and restoring confidence in the rule of law. During the PRS period, it created the Liberia Anti-Corruption Commission (LACC), the Public Procurement and Concession Commission (PPCC), and the Liberia Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (LEITI). To make government institutions more transparent, capable, and oriented toward service delivery, the Government created a comprehensive Civil Service Reform Strategy, which reduced the number of civil service employees, and rationalized the functions and mandates of nine ministries and agencies (M&As). The delivery of justice improved as the Government developed and implemented a national and county-level case management system; deployed public defenders throughout the country; and replenished the ranks of trained magistrates for the first time in 20 years. Policies that increasingly put power in the hands of local communities are taking hold with the passing of the Community Rights Law, endorsement of a National Decentralization Policy, and the creation of county-level branches for government service-delivery.

The PRS also focused on building the capacity of the health, education, and social service systems- improving institutions and service delivery. To improve education, 439 schools were constructed, renovated, or rehabilitated, while teachers were trained and received salaries that matched their qualifications. School curricula were modernized and aligned with West African standards. In the health sector, functioning health facilities increased from 354 to 550; health workers increased from approximately 5,000 to more than 8,000; and the number of facilities accredited for provision of services increased. These investments are beginning to show results in increased school enrollment at all levels; increased levels of schooling and training for teachers; and substantially improved health outcomes.

The Lift Liberia PRS made great strides toward recovery, but it did not meet all of its goals due to the country's enormous institutional and human capacity deficits. Moreover, in the process of addressing institutional concerns, some important opportunities for achieving immediate measurable results were missed. The AfT places greater focus on interventions to target the most pressing problems and binding constraints, while capitalizing on the lessons learned from the Lift Liberia PRS.

1.4 REMAINING BINDING CONSTRAINTS TO GROWTH

To reach its targeted levels of growth, Liberia will need high levels of investment. As a result of underinvestment during the civil war, combined with the depreciation and destruction of public and private infrastructure, the value of capital stock per unit of labor in Liberia has substantially declined. Currently, the average Liberian worker has about one quarter of the value of capital stock available prior to 1980.4 In order to understand the main constraints to higher investment in the country, a growth diagnostic study was undertaken and the following key remaining challenges to stimulating increased investment and growth were identified:

• Weak infrastructure-especially roads and power. The World Bank's Doing Business 2012 survey of Liberian firms5 shows that 59 percent identify electricity as a major constraint and 39 percent identify transportation as a major constraint.6 Despite the fact that infrastructure programs received the largest amount of funding during the PRS period, most of the country is still connected only through seasonal laterite roads and occasional electricity supply. Poor roads limit the ability of farmers to get their goods to markets, and also constrain development of some of the Liberia's most promising sectors-agriculture, tree crops, and forestry. Electricity supply is mainly confined to the capital and power tariffs are US$0.54 per kilowatt hour (kWh) on average, which is three times higher than the Sub-Saharan African average. Private businesses often rely on their own generators, at high cost-a serious constraint to small-scale manufacturing and industrial MSMEs.

• Difficulty in accessing finance. This constraint is particularly critical for manufacturing and agricultural MSMEs. Due to a high incidence of non-performing loans, high informality, and low financial literacy among borrowers, Liberian banks are generally risk averse. Most loans are short term and extended mainly for trading and other service activities. Loans to manufacturing and agricultural activities, which are needed to fuel emerging MSMEs, account for less than 10 percent of total bank loans. Although the Government has been easing registration procedures to make it more attractive for small businesses to formalize, the majority of firms still exist in the informal sector, further limiting their ability to access finance. As a result, only 10 percent of firms used banks to finance investment in 2009. In the Doing Business survey, 40 percent of Liberian firms cite finance as

Results based on a survey of 150 firms

conducted during September 2008- February 2009.

the number one constraint of the business environment, compared to roughly 20 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa and 16 percent globally.

• Difficulty in launching new export activities, due to missing inputs (also known as coordination failures). Diversifying Liberia's economy beyond the traditional natural resource-dependent export products and toward other agricultural and small-scale manufacturing products and services is a key priority. Although numerous studies have shown that Liberia has a comparative advantage in exporting cocoa, coffee and other tree crops, semi-processed agricultural goods, and light manufactured textiles, these value chains are still very weak and key inputs such as affordable fertilizer, farm-to-market transportation, cold storage, and affordable electricity are often lacking. A number of donor, NGO, private sector and government initiatives are addressing these gaps, but these activities are poorly coordinated.

• Weak and unclear property rights. Land ownership in Liberia has a complex and confusing history, with land rights alternating between communities and the state. Today, less than 20 percent of the country's total land is privately titled and registered. During the PRS, the Government adopted the Community Rights Law (2006) and the Community Right Act (2009) in order to properly formalize community ownership. Despite these attempts, land rights remain poorly defined, with many rural lands having overlapping and unresolved ownership. Implementing records management and land registration systems for rural property-an unfulfilled deliverable from the PRS-remains a priority. In the Doing Business 2012 indicators, Liberia is ranked 176th out of 183 countries in terms of ease and cost of registering property. Commercial contract enforcement is also a challenge. To address this problem, in 2011 the Government established a separate Commercial Court to help clear the backlog of cases and improve contract enforcement.

Other challenges to growth and inclusiveness include:

• Low levels of human development. Years of war interrupted schooling for many citizens, resulting in low educational attainment. Further, the war interrupted people's ability to acquire practical work experience, and there is a general lack of management and entrepreneurship skills and business and financial literacy, all of which are critical for the growth of MSMEs. The education system is still being rebuilt and is struggling to deliver quality practical and vocational training. Private sector-led training and educational support services are still in their infancy. A discrepancy between demand and supply of skills may become even more apparent as jobs are created that require specialized skills training (e.g., specialized personnel in mining, agricultural processing, and tourism). The Liberian civil service also faces capacity constraints.

• High administrative and regulatory costs. Although the Government has reduced red tape, MSMEs continue to face unnecessary legal and regulatory burdens and are subject to onerous licensing regimes. The costs of getting permits, paying taxes and trading across borders are still high. Petty corruption (payments for licenses, bribes at checkpoints, etc.) adds additional burdens.

• Continued risks regarding security and stability. The risk of instability arises from both the threat of internal tensions and external conflicts in neighboring countries. Maintaining peace and security is sine qua non for attracting domestic and foreign investment and stimulating growth in the long run. As Liberia transitions to taking responsibility for domestic security from UNMIL, significant investment will be needed to maintain a stable and peaceful environment, conducive to the growth of economic activities.

As Liberia moves into its next five-year period of development, the country plans to make significant progress on easing each of these constraints, while prioritizing some over others (e.g., electricity and road infrastructure will be the top priority in the immediate term). Overall, the Government's goal is to achieve double-digit rates of economic growth, which is ambitious but achievable with high investments in critical primary growth sectors.

Potential Constraint Traditional Export Sectors (e.g., concessions, large-scale agriculture)

Non Traditional Tradable Sectors (e.g., small-scale agriculture, manufacturing, tourism, services)

Geography Not binding. Excellent location, favorable climate, rich in natural resources.

Infrastructure Not binding. Can be circumvented through private provision. Binding. High cost/lack of access to electricity and roads reduces competitiveness of otherwise potentially attractive sectors.

Human capital A problem, but not currently binding. Traditional sectors can circumvent by importing skilled labor.

A problem, but not currently binding. A lack of education and skills, especially among the population that missed out on schooling during the war. However, unemployment and underemployment among more educated is also high.

Macro risks Not binding, although risks related to exposure to shocks in international commodity prices will need to be monitored and managed.

Not binding. Future risks related to revenue volatility, commodity price volatility, real exchange rate appreciation and Dutch Disease need to be monitored and managed.

Micro risks Not binding, but land tenure issues and lack of clarity on land-use policy, including clarity on the concession process, constitute areas of future risk. Binding. Clarity and security of property rights is an area of concern.

Information externalities

Not binding. Businesses are aware of what opportunities are within reach.

Coordination externalities Not binding for large corporations. Binding, as new activities that require a different set of inputs and skills than what is available generally fail to emerge, especially for MSMEs in the agriculture sector, processing and manufacturing.

Lack of international finance

Not binding. Liberia is funded to a high degree by external sources, and increases in such funding could encounter a limit in absorptive capacity.

Lack of local finance

Not binding. Capital accumulation by banks has been growing and reserves are sufficient.

Poor financial intermediation Not binding for large enterprises that can self-provide finance or source finance internationally.

Binding. Banks have capital but are unwilling to extend credit (especially long-term loans) to the agriculture and manufacturing sectors due to high perceived risk of non-payment, poor recourse.

Lack of access roads and bridges reduces competitiveness of otherwise potentially attractive sectors

CHAPTER 2.

LIBERIA RISING 2030-ACHIEVING MIDDLE

INCOME STATUS

2.1 INTRODUCTION

Liberia aspires to become a middle-income country by the year 2030. As discussed in Chapter 1, Liberia was on the cusp of becoming a middle-income country by the 1980s; and was one of the highest-income countries in Africa. But years of conflict have reversed the country's development. As part of its development agenda, the Government undertook the development of Liberia RISING 2030, a visioning exercise that included the perspectives of diverse stakeholders from Liberian society and took a broad view of Liberia's economic, political, social, and human development over an 18-year timeframe (2012- 2030).

While Liberia RISING 2030 sets the broad aspiration for the country, the AfT defines the initial steps toward that vision. It provides the medium-term planning framework to guide public investment programs and ensure inclusive growth, reduce marginalization, and build human, social and physical capital. It operationalizes the vision by outlining the major priorities and interventions required for growth and wealth creation in Liberia. Given that the National Vision and the AfT were developed simultaneously, provisions will be made for annual reviews of the AfT to ensure that it remains consistent with the National Vision.

This chapter outlines the vision and defines what middle income means in the Liberian context, and describes the path that Liberia must follow to reach this goal. The chapter then describes the experiences of a number of other countries that were able to achieve middle-income status in recent years.

2.2 THE NATIONAL VISION OF MIDDLE INCOME IN THE CONTEXT OF LIBERIA

While there is no single standard definition of middle-income status, it is often defined as per capita income of more than US$1,000 (in constant terms).7 Starting from Liberia's current level of income per capita, crossing the middle-income threshold requires the economy to grow by about 9 percent per year from 2012 until 2030. This goal may be ambitious, but not unachievable. For example, from 2006 until 2010, Liberia's GDP grew at 7 percent, on average-and this was before major export activities and investments had been rekindled. Moreover, a number of low-income countries that transitioned to middle-income during the last decade-including a number of African countries (Angola, Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Congo, Lesotho, Equatorial Guinea)-achieved per capita gross national income (GNI) growth of 9 percent or higher over an 18-year period (1993 - 2011). Several countries in Asia that crossed to middle-income status in the last decade (including Indonesia, China, and Vietnam) grew even faster over the same period.

7 The World Bank defined middle-income countries as those with a GNI per capita level above $1,005 and below

$12,275. Gross National Income (GNI) comprises the total value of all goods and services generated by a country in one year (its GDP) plus the net income from domestic factors of production used abroad (notably interest and dividends) minus the income of foreign factors of production operating in a country. The World Bank measures GNI according to the Atlas method, which adjusts for exchange rate fluctuations and reports each country's income in real U.S. dollars. (http://data.worldbank.org/about/country-classifications).

While Liberia will target the GNI per capita threshold of roughly US$1,000 as an overarching target for its economic development, the country must also meet other economic, political, social, and human development targets as well. By 2030, the country aims to have a peaceful and inclusive political system, a diversified economy, stable institutions, and healthy and productive citizens. The Government will earn its legitimacy by providing efficient services to all Liberians, investing in public goods, and working consciously to equalize economic opportunities, while relying increasingly on market forces and proper regulations. Furthermore, working with traditional systems, the Government will administer and enforce justice and the rule of law.

2.3 THE PATH TO MIDDLE-INCOME STATUS

Liberia is one of 35 low-income countries (LICs) in the world, and one of 26 Sub-Saharan African countries.8 In recent years, many LICs have experienced rapid growth and are quickly approaching the middle-income threshold. Liberia is currently among the poorest countries in this group-although in 1979, it was the third wealthiest and at par with many other countries that have since crossed over into middle income. Table 2.1 shows the 33 countries that have crossed from low- to middle-income status during the period 2000-2011.9

Table 2.1: Countries that Crossed into Middle-Income, 2000-2011

Period Country Name Total

2000-2002 China, Equatorial Guinea, Honduras, Syria 4 2003-2005 Angola, Azerbaijan, Bhutan, Congo, Rep., Georgia, Indonesia, Turkmenistan 7

2009-2011 Cote d'Ivoire, Lao PDR, Mauritania, Pakistan, Senegal, Solomon Islands, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Yemen, Zambia 10

Source: World Development Indicators (WDI). Sub-Saharan African countries underlined.

This large number of transitions is a result of sustained long-term growth in a number of countries. Due to a favorable external environment, the majority of these countries experienced an average growth rate of more than 10 percent per year during the 2000s. Over the 18-year period (comparable to the period to 2030 in which Liberia aspires to reach middle-income status), the average growth of the whole group was 7.1 percent, ranging from 1.5 percent in the Solomon Islands to 22.7 percent in Equatorial Guinea.

What are some of the lessons that Liberia can draw from the experience of these countries? While there is no one key factor that can explain every country's transition to middle income, some broad similarities do exist. These include:

Favorable external environment. Strong global demand and high prices for primary commodities in the years leading up to the late 2000s improved terms of trade and fueled income growth.10 Some of the strongest performers overall, in terms of average GNI per capita growth, were natural resource-rich

economies-Equatorial Guinea, Angola, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan-each with a more than 50 percent share of resource rents in GDP. However, a number of these countries also saw reversals in their terms of trade starting in 2008, which illustrates the risks associated with the boom-bust nature of commodity prices for natural resource-exporting countries.

Improvements in the business environment. The 2000s gave rise to a number of new indicators for tracking and benchmarking country performance on measures of the business environment,11 and many countries took up reform agendas. Almost all the transitioning countries achieved positive improvements in the absolute level of their business environment and governance indicators. For example, Ghana, Lesotho, and Senegal achieved significant improvement in business reform indicators while Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, and Nigeria achieved significant improvement in governance indicators.

Gains in human development. The Human Development Index (HDI) measures life expectancy, educational attainment and income. Each crossover country experienced an improvement in the HDI during the 2000s, even after excluding GNI per capita from the index to focus on the other measures of performance.12 The best performers improved their HDI ratings by more than 15 percent, including Yemen, Indonesia, Pakistan, Senegal, and India. Other top performers on this measure included Mongolia, Nicaragua, Solomon Islands, Laos, and Honduras. The growth rates of these countries were, on average, lower than that of the resource-intensive economies. However, resource-rich countries were less likely to enact reforms that were as significant.

Dividends of sustained peace. Nine of the 33 countries that transitioned had experienced a period of war in the 15 years leading up to 2005, but were not at war in 2010. These countries experienced somewhat higher average short-run GNI/capita growth compared to the group as a whole; however, they had significantly lower average 18-year growth. This suggests some effect of conflict recovery or a "peace dividend" in the short term but not in the long term.

Table 2.2 compares selected economic and development indicators for Liberia, all low-income countries, and the group that crossed to middle income in the last decade. It suggests that Liberia needs to play catch-up on many economic indicators in order to reach middle-income status, including its level of GNI per capita, share of industry and services in GDP, domestic taxes and savings. One advantage is Liberia's competitiveness with many LICs and MICs on the Doing Business indicators (including a low tax rate). However, its infrastructure is a clear disadvantage compared to other countries.

Population indicators show that Liberia has a significantly smaller population but higher fertility than its peers. Moderate population growth is an important factor in achieving higher per capita wealth. Health and education indicators show that Liberia is lagging behind its peers on most indicators, but not by a big margin. In fact, statistics suggest that the country already has a higher youth literacy rate compared to LIC peers. If concentrated efforts and recent upward trends in health and education indicators continue, Liberia can expect to catch up.

11For example, the World Bank Doing Business index and Enterprise survey; the Global Competitiveness Report of

the World Economic Forum, the index of Economic Freedom by the Heritage Foundation and others. 12 The only exception was Lesotho, where the HDI declined due to a recorded decrease in average life expectancy.

Before discussing the goals and the objectives that need to be set for Liberia to reach middle-income status, it is important to first review the internal context of poverty, geography, and population. External environments are also critical to defining the opportunities and risks to countries' development agendas, as shown in the experience of countries that have transitioned to middle income. Therefore, the next two chapters focus on the internal and external context of Liberia.

CHAPTER 3.

GEOGRAPHY, POPULATION, DEMOGRAPHICS, AND

POVERTY

3.1 INTRODUCTION

Despite achievements of recent years, Liberia remains one of the poorest nations in the world as it recovers from decades of conflict. Both a challenge and an opportunity, more than 50 percent of its population comprises young adults between 15 and 34 years of age. While this population is highly urbanized and increasingly educated, high population growth and urbanization exert pressure on available resources (basic services, infrastructure, and jobs) and must influence strategic decisions. Considering future trends in population is critical, as some estimates show the population doubling by 2038. Finally, understanding what it means to be poor in the Liberian context, and which regions and groups are most vulnerable to poverty, informs the strategic choices of this AfT, the purpose of which is to provide greater access to opportunity and improve livelihoods for all Liberians.

3.2 GEOGRAPHY

The Republic of Liberia occupies about 37,420 square miles and is located on the western bulge of Africa; bordered by Guinea to the north, Côte D'Ivoire to the east, Sierra Leone to the west, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south. It is the oldest independent nation on the west coast of Africa and consists of 17 ethnic groups, including indigenous populations and descendants of repatriated American slaves who founded modern Liberia in 1822. The capital, Monrovia, is the seat of the central Government, and the country is further divided into 15 administrative divisions known as counties: Bomi, Bong, Gparbolu, Grand Bassa, Grand Cape Mount, Grand Gedeh, Grand Kru, Lofa, Margibi, Maryland, Montserrado, Nimba, River Cess, River Gee, and Sinoe (Figure 3.1). By far the most populous is Montserrado County, which houses the capital, followed by Nimba, Lofa, and Grand Bassa counties.

Liberia's topography features coastal lagoons and mangrove marshlands, rainforest, and mountainous plateaus. Liberia's coast extends for 350 miles and is home to some of the country's largest cities and conducive to fishing and tourism. The rainforest occupies roughly 45 percent of Liberia's land and is the source of its timber resources. The plateaus occupy 27 percent of the land and are cultivated for agriculture, and the mountains (including Mount Nimba and Putu Mountain) are home to mineral resources-especially iron ore, gold, and diamonds. Liberia also has significant hydro resources, including the Cavalla River, the St. John River, and the St. Paul River, which offer the potential for hydroelectricity.

Figure 3.1: Counties in Liberia and the Spatial Distribution of Population, 2008

3.3 POPULATION AND DEMOGRAPHICS

Liberia's population has a number of notable features, including (a) a high rate of fertility; (b) an extremely high ratio of youth; (c) a high degree of urbanization; and (d) relatively high literacy and education levels among the youth. Table 3.1 shows the population trend over the past five decades. According to the 2008 census, the population was close to 3.5 million. While overall population density is still relatively low, population growth rates are high. The population grew at an average rate of 3.3 percent annually between 1962 and 1974, and 3.4 percent during 1974 and 1984. Between 1984 and 2008, average growth was 2.1 percent, reflecting the population exodus and losses during the civil war.

Table 3.1: Population Trends in Liberia, 1962-2008 (census statistics)

1962 1974 1984 2008

Population 1,016,443 1,503,368 2,101,628 3,489,072

Population change - 486,925 598,260 1,387,444

Average annual increase - 40,577 59,826 57,810

Percentage increase (total) - 48 40 66

Average annual rate of growth - 3.3 3.4 2.1

Sex ratio (male to female) - - 102.0 102.3

Fertility levels, while below the levels of the 1980s, are still very high. There is some evidence that the fertility rate declined from 7.1 in 1984 to 5.8 in 2008. During this time, infant mortality was reduced almost by half, from 144 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1984 to 78 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2008. Because of these trends, Liberia's population is very young, with 42 percent below the age of 15. The result is increasing pressure for the provision of health care, education, housing, food, transportation and employment. Even if fertility levels decrease, the existing dynamic means that the dependency ratio will remain high for years to come, and Liberia is unlikely to see a demographic dividend in the next several decades.

During the civil war, Liberia saw a large internal migration from rural to urban areas; its urbanization is now much higher than other low-income countries. As of 2008, 48.7 percent of households lived in urban areas and 51.3 percent lived in rural areas. Despite the high urban density (especially in Monrovia), people are reluctant to return to rural areas where there are more poverty and fewer economic opportunities. Table 3.2 shows the rural-urban dichotomy of Liberia. While fertility averages 4.9 children per mother in urban areas, the rural area average is 6.5 per mother. Infant mortality is higher in rural areas (84/1000) compared to urban areas (68/1000), and both maternal and under age 5 mortality rates are higher in rural areas. Literacy is also lower among the rural population.

3.4 DEMOGRAPHIC PROJECTIONS

A recent analysis of population trends in Liberia, commissioned as part of the Vision 2030 process, created projections of population variables to facilitate strategy development and planning. The key determinant of population levels and trends is inevitably how fast fertility is reduced. Assuming that fertility levels fall from current levels of 5.2 in 2008 to 2.4 (low scenario), 3.5 (medium scenario), or 4.2 (high scenario) by 2038, the population of Liberia is likely to grow anywhere from 53 percent to 90 percent (Table 3.4).

Table 3.4: Total Population under Three Different Fertility Scenarios, 2008-2038

Source: Retrospective Analysis of the Liberian People, Ministry of Planning and Economic Affairs (2011).

An important contributor to reducing fertility is the rate of female employment, since women's fertility levels are strongly correlated to levels of employment. Under current projections, the demographic dividend is not likely to occur in Liberia until about 2050. At that time, the working-age population will have grown to at least 4 million. If Liberians enjoy high employment rates and women have fewer children, there will be a significant shift in the age structure of the population. If employment levels are low (particularly for women), fertility moderation may not materialize, which would lead to higher population growth and greater demand on resources.

Table 3.5: Working-age Population under Three Different Fertility Scenarios, 2008-2038

Source: Retrospective Analysis of the Liberian People, Ministry of Planning and Economic Affairs, 2011.

Closely tied to employment and fertility rates is education. The provision of universal primary education offers a solid foundation to improve household decision making and job opportunities in a way that promotes socioeconomic development and reduces fertility levels. Recognizing the importance of education for boys and girls, the Government has committed to boosting primary school enrollment through its "free and compulsory primary school" policy. Table 3.6 shows a projection of education-sector requirements based on assumptions of medium fertility and 100 percent enrolment by 2015 (MDG target of universal primary education).

Table 3.7: Health Sector Indicators under Medium Fertility Scenario, 2008-2038

Source: Retrospective Analysis of the Liberian People, Ministry of Planning and Economic Affairs, 2011.

As noted above, Liberia's current fertility rates are high and available resources to meet the population's basic needs are inadequate. Moreover, there is little evidence that the current high dependency ratio will dramatically change in the next several decades, due to the inherent population momentum created by earlier periods of high fertility. High population growth will stretch demand for basic social services for years to come. In order to counteract these trends, Liberia needs to increase the provision of basic social services and stimulate job growth, while simultaneously reducing fertility levels through education and economic opportunities for girls and young women. Liberia will also need to increase economic opportunities in its rural areas to counter high rural-to-urban migration.

Section III of this strategy identifies how to address these trends, including the need to improve basic service delivery; create economic opportunities in rural and urban areas; improve human development outcomes; and prioritize the education and empowerment of women and girls.

3.5 DIMENSIONS OF POVERTY IN LIBERIA

Many approaches are used in measuring poverty. One is the income and consumption expenditure approach, which defines a threshold below which individuals or households are considered poor. Based on a threshold of US$1 a day, 64 percent of the Liberian population was poor in 2008. This varies from 68 percent in rural areas to 55 percent in urban areas.

The 2008 census employed two additional ways to determine poverty. The first concept is the Unmet Basic Needs (UBN) Index, which gauges the extent to which households and individuals strive to satisfy their basic needs. The goods and services included in this index are quality of housing, ownership of assets, access to health services, safe water, solid waste management system, literacy, and employment status of the household head, among others. The UBN approach shows that poverty is widespread in Liberia. According to the census, Rivercess County had the highest proportion of households with unmet basic needs (82 percent), followed by Grand Kru County (78 percent), and Gbarpolu and Rivergee (75 percent each). These counties are geographically isolated, with poor road conditions, lack basic social services, and a low level of concessions and other vibrant economic activities.

A Brief History of the Population Program in Liberia and Available Sources of Data Prior to the war, Liberia had undertaken censuses in 1962, 1974 and 1984; however, the statistics from these are either extremely scarce or completely lost. Since the end of the war, the country conducted the Liberia Demographic and Health Survey (LDHS) in 2007 and the National Population and Housing Census in 2008. Because there are no complete population registers and surveys have not been conducted on a regular basis, the resulting demographic statistics must be interpreted with a degree of caution. In order to ensure the effective integration of population variables into national development planning, the Liberian Government created the National Committee on Population Activities (NCPA) in 1983 and the National Population Commission (NPC) in 1988. The NCP developed an institutional framework for coordinating population activities in the country known as the National Population Commission, comprising twenty public and private agencies. The commission formulated a policy known as "National Policy on Population for Social and Development" in 1988, which was subsequently revised in 2005.

Another proxy used in poverty analysis is "essential assets" and "non-essential assets" deficiency. Nonessential assets deficiency entails the absence of items such as a vehicle, television, or mobile phone, while essential deficiency means the absence of a mattress, basic furniture, or radio. According to 2008 census figures, essential assets deficiency in Liberia was about 85 percent, on average. Non-essential assets deficiency was about 96 percent. Nimba, Bong, Grand Cape Mount, Bomi, and Rivercess counties were found to have the highest essential assets deficiency, all higher than 90 percent. Of the remaining counties, only Montserrado and Maryland counties had a less than 80 percent deficiency in essential assets (Figure 3.2).

Figure 3.2: Percentage of Households with Essential Assets Deficiency by County

3.6. OTHER DIMENSIONS OF POVERTY

Lack of access to infrastructure represents another dimension of poverty. Electricity deficiency for both lighting and cooking stands at about 95 percent in Liberia. Pipe-borne water as the main source of drinking water is low, and water deficiency is about 61 percent. The incidence of improper waste disposal is very high, with 87 percent of households having no access to flush toilets on a regular basis.

Unemployment and under-employment is another proxy for poverty. According to the 2008 census, of the 2,834,733 Liberians of working age, 37.5 percent (1,063,024) were employed, 10.6 percent (300,481) were unemployed, and 51.9 percent were inactive. Those considered inactive are most often in school or attend to household duties. The relatively moderate rate of official unemployment masks a much larger problem of high job informality and vulnerable employment. According to the 2010 Liberia Labor Force Survey, 68 percent of employed Liberians work in the informal sector without regular wages and benefits. More than half the employed population is self-employed or provides non-wage labor within their households. In rural areas, a significant portion of the labor force is in traditional small-scale agriculture and family work rather than cash crop production. More than half of those employed are uneducated, which leads to low productivity and low wages. Overall, Liberia faces the dual challenge of improving the quality and productivity of work for those with vulnerable employment, and of creating work for young people who will enter the labor force in the coming years.

Lack of access to education is also a facet of poverty. Many Liberians' education was interrupted by war. Among the population older than age 15, only 19 percent have attained some level of primary education, while 15 percent have attained some level of secondary education. However, the number of students completing primary and secondary education has increased over the years; as a result, youth today are significantly more educated than previously. According to the 2008 census, 69 percent of the population between the ages of 15 and 24 are literate.13 This is fairly high among African countries. However, large disparities continue to exist between urban and rural areas and among the different regions of Liberia. While urban dwellers have an average literacy rate of 70 percent, about 58 percent of their rural counterparts are literate. At the county level, literacy rates range from a low of 36 percent in Grand Bassa to a high of 73 percent in Montserrado. Quality of education remains another concern. As of the 2007/2008 National School Census Report, only 41 percent of the teachers in Liberia were trained. However, teacher training institutions are currently operating and increasing the number of teachers with formal training.

Years of conflict also disrupted the health care delivery system, with poor access to health care being yet another dimension of poverty. While the health sector is transitioning from emergency to development- data from the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (2009) showed a significant increase in the number of health facilities in Liberia, including those managed by the state, NGOs and private individuals and organizations-a large percentage of the population, especially the rural and urban poor, still has limited access to health and social welfare. The result is poor health outcomes, in particular a high incidence of malaria, accounting for 69 percent of the total most prevalent diseases cases in 2009; high maternal mortality; and high child mortality. The Government has sought to establish a package of free basic health care of acceptable quality, the Basic Package of Health Services (BPHS), and make it available in 70 percent of the health facilities by 2010. However, lack of access to health care services remains a concern.

CHAPTER 4. EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT: OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES

4.1 INTRODUCTION

The last decade has seen a number of developing countries rise to the global stage of political and economic power, most notably Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS). Their rise has in turn affected global supply and demand for resources, capital and labor. As a resource-rich country on the African continent, Liberia can expect to leverage the strong global demand for resources and the appetites of investors to invest-both in export sectors, such as resources and agriculture; and in non-traded sectors, such as infrastructure, local retail, telecommunications and finance. Rapid expansion of investment in mining and infrastructure could drive the kind of GDP growth that Liberia needs to reach the middle-income threshold. However, in order for such growth to be sustainable, the Liberian Government will need to carefully manage the negative side effects of openness and the internal social, demographic and political risks that can result. This chapter highlights the opportunities and challenges of Liberia's external environment.

4.2. OPPORTUNITIES FROM THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT

A strong demand for resources and agriculture: Global demand for primary resources and food is driven mainly by global population and income growth. According to the United Nations, the world population is expected to grow from 7.0 billion in 2011 to 9.3 billion in 2050.14 The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that global food production needs to increase roughly 50 percent from current levels in order to meet future demand for food by 2050.15 In addition, the world's incomes per capita will continue to grow at about 4 percent for the foreseeable future.16 Sub-Saharan Africa is projected to grow between 5 and 6 percent per year.

As a result of these trends, prices of petroleum, minerals, grains and other basic materials have been high since the early 2000s. On the supply side, agricultural yields have reached a plateau in many of the world's food producing regions. Established sources of energy and minerals are also becoming less productive, and global companies are turning to new sources-Liberia can harness these trends. Among African countries, Liberia currently has one of the lowest agricultural yields and lowest intensities of land use, meaning that there is an opportunity for farmers to increase productivity. Liberia is also rich in iron ore and other minerals. It has already signed agreements that are posed to contribute more than US$10 billion of investment into the mining sector over the next few years. Oil exploration activities on the shores of Liberia are also underway. Well-managed investments in these areas have the potential to propel Liberia's growth, and fund diversification and development in other areas of the economy.

The globalization of investment: In the last two decades, global foreign investment flows have increased more than fivefold, from US$207 billion in 1990 to US$1.2 trillion in 2010.17 Foreign direct investment (FDI) to Africa increased from US$11 billion in 2000 to US$55 billion in 2010, surpassing both aid and

remittances. Given the potential for growth that followed the many years of underinvestment, direct foreign investment to Liberia rose from virtually nothing to US$1.3 billion between 2006 and 2010. And the benefits of foreign investment go beyond just capital. Foreign investment can bring management methods, skills, technology, new industries and sectors, and productive know-how that facilitate the growth of other industries. FDI can also serve to create demand for upstream and downstream local products and services, stimulating the growth of local enterprises. It brings tax revenue to governments, which can be used to fund development priorities. Liberia has already embarked on programs that seek to connect its local businesses and entrepreneurs with large concessionaires in order to foster linkages and multiply the benefits of their presence it the country. This represents an opportunity for continued growth, as the Government is committed to continue such initiatives under the current development agenda.

New actors: BRICS, among others, have increasingly expanded their global footprint. From 1990 through 2008, Asia's share of Sub-Saharan trade doubled, while Western Europe's portion declined from 51 to 28 percent.18 Today, countries in Sub-Saharan Africa conduct half of their trade with developing regions (South-South). China accounts for about 40 percent of global metal consumption and 18 percent of energy consumption. It also is home to the world's largest reserves of capital, which it is increasingly investing abroad. The rise of China and other major actors, and competition among them for resources and markets, has increased the opportunities for governments to negotiate mutually beneficial agreements, such investments in local infrastructure. Since 2005, China's monetary commitments to infrastructure in Africa have exceeded those of the World Bank.19

Philanthropic organizations, NGOs, social enterprises, and other partnerships are also experimenting with more creative development models. While these actors still account for a small share of total capital flows to developing countries, they face fewer constraints and thus can more easily innovate, test new models, and scale up proven successes. Liberia has already attracted significant investment by enterprises from China and other emerging economies, and has opened its doors to a host of developmental and social enterprises.

Technological innovations: New innovations in technology are continuously creating opportunities to enhance domestic and global governance. For example, recent years have witnessed international efforts to price and trade the rights to environmental externalities. Developed countries have plans to spend billions of dollars to sequester carbon by reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. Many developing countries, due to their less intense use of land and lower agricultural productivity, face relatively lower costs of environmental abatement. Liberia is in a position to benefit from abatement programs due to its vast forest reserves, if these markets develop. African countries are also implementing biometric identification technology, which can enable direct transfers from governments to citizens and thus improve economic governance. Liberia is well positioned to experiment with such technologies. Finally, with advancements in information technologies, citizens have more and better ways to both shape and oversee their governments.

Regional integration: Compared to other regions of the world, African countries are still not highly integrated with one other. Trade between African countries represents just 12 percent of the continent's

18McKinsey Global Institute- Lions on the move: The progress and potential of African economies (http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/mgi/research/productivity_competitiveness_and_growth/lions_on_the_move) total exports and imports, compared to 21 percent for Latin America and 39 percent for Asia.20 Expanding intra-African trade and creating larger regional markets create opportunities for future growth. In the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), intra-regional trade accounts for approximately 10 percent of all trade by member countries.21 However, the community is taking steps toward increasing cooperation and decreasing barriers, with the goal of creating a single market by 2030. Regional infrastructure projects are also on the rise. Liberia is partnering with Sierra Leone, Cote d'Ivoire and Guinea on the West African Power Pool (WAPP), a US$500 million regional power transmission and distribution project expected to decrease the cost and increase the year-round availability of power. The ECOWAS countries are also working toward a regional Road Transport and Transit Facilitation program, which includes the planned development of integrated border posts and a West African regional interconnecting railway network.

4.3. CHALLENGES POSED BY THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT

Volatile commodity prices: Commodity boom and bust cycles have been pronounced in recent years. A commodity boom and the ensuing food crisis in Africa reached a peak in 2008, when prices for staples doubled or tripled. From the perspective of food- and commodity-importing countries such as Liberia, increased volatility can endanger food security, exacerbate poverty, and even lead to unrest. The Government of Liberia counteracted the 2008 price increase in rice relatively well though proactive policies that limited exports and mark-ups on rice. However, it is critical that governments keep close watch on global trends in demand and prices, ready to proactively counteract large volatilities. Liberia's natural advantages as a food producer and the strategy to strengthen agriculture, which is an integral part of this AfT, will help to reduce shocks in the medium term for Liberian households.

From a producer's perspective, current prospects of high commodity prices are largely favorable to the terms of trade. Historically, however, commodity prices have shown a tendency to decline in real terms.22 The current prospects of high prices depend heavily on the assumption of continued growth, primarily in China. Careful macroeconomic management in times of plenty and a watch on tendencies in other markets are warranted to detect any slowdown and permit early and gradual adjustments. Liberia is wise to learn from its past, when its reliance on iron ore exports exposed vulnerabilities as iron prices plummeted in the late 1970s. In the long run, greater diversification of exports is a steadier way for countries to become less exposed to commodity price swings.

20McKinsey Global Institute. 21 The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) was founded in 1975 and has 15 member states.

Volatile capital flows: International capital can also be a source of volatility. Both private and donor inflows to developing countries tend to be pro-cyclical, rising in good times and falling in bad times. For example, global FDI inflows decreased by 12 and 32 percent in 2008 and 2009, respectively, before growing again by 5 percent in 2010. The volatility of external capital can exacerbate business cycles and increase turmoil. Having the right institutional capacity to manage inflows of international capital represents a challenge for many developing counties. Competition among investors for limited opportunities can create opportunities for corruption. At the same time, international governance mechanisms in this area are still in their infancy.

Foreign direct investment can also cause a backlash from civil society if communities are left out of the process. In Liberia, a retrospective analysis completed for Vision 2030 shows that questions around land ownership and management of concessions represent one of the major sources of conflict.23 Other parts of this strategy describe the Liberian Government's plans to counteract these risks by investing in pubic goods, furthering the domestic private sector, and saving for downturns.

Regional instability: The Mano River Union remains fragile. Liberia's immediate neighbors are at varying stages of recovery from conflict, as Guinea adjusts to the passing of its longtime ruler in 2008 and Côte d'Ivoire deals with the recent conflict surrounding its disputed election. Beyond political conflict, organized regional crime (including trafficking) is also a threat to regional peace and security. The subregion is still seen as one of the most volatile on the continent, and more than 16,000 United Nations peacekeeping troops remain stationed in Côte d'Ivoire and Liberia. Joint security issues also arise from the movement of refugees and fighters across borders. Liberia has repeatedly seen evidence that regional instability quickly tends to spill over, in terms of refugees and violence. This AfT acknowledges the importance of securing Liberia's borders and describes the Government's strategy for collaborating with its neighbors on issues of joint security and joint economic interest.

23 Liberia Retrospective Analysis, Ministry of Planning and Economic Affairs, 2011.

Trends in Global Food and Commodity Prices The figure to the right shows that food and fuel prices have been rising starkly since 2000. In 2010 food prices were 80 percent higher and fuel prices 175 percent higher than a decade prior. However, the figure also shows that in many ways, the year 2000 was an historical low point after prices had declined for several decades. The historical trends clearly show that international food and energy price movement can be dramatic and very difficult to predict. Price forecasts, such as price futures, have been shown to be inaccurate predictors. Swings in international prices affect domestic prices of foods and commodities, though not one-for-one. The average size of the "pass-though" has been estimated at 0.38 for developing economies, but the actual effect in a given country will depend on how import-dependent that country is. Liberia, as a net importer of rice and fuel, is exposed to fluctuations in the prices of those goods. Source: International Monetary Fund: World Economic Outlook. September 2011.

SECTION II: MEDIUM-TERM GROWTH AND

DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY

CHAPTER 5 DEVELOPING LIBERIA'S GROWTH STRATEGY- METHOD AND PROCESS

5.1 INTRODUCTION

The development of Liberia's medium-term economic growth and development strategy (AfT) was institutionally anchored in the Liberia Reconstruction and Development Committee (LRDC) at the Ministry of Planning and Economic Affairs (MPEA). The primary reason for using the LRDC structure to coordinate the formulation of the strategy was that it needed to be based on the gains made as well as the unfinished agenda and lessons learned from the implementation of the Lift Liberia PRS, which was also housed inside the LRDC. In addition, the LRDC is part of the Ministry of Planning and Economic Affairs, which has the statutory mandate to coordinate development planning and to lead monitoring and evaluation (M&E), in coordination with the Liberia Institute for Statistics and Geo-Information Services (LISGIS). Moreover, the implementation structure used for the Lift Liberia PRS proved suitable in bringing together key actors-the Government, private sector, civil society and international development partners-to develop the new medium-term growth and development strategy. The relevant actors, who had worked together over the years on reform issues, came together to examine outstanding challenges and key interventions needed to achieve sustained and inclusive growth and development.

Because it was strategically important to link this medium-term growth and development strategy to a long-term national vision, this strategy was developed simultaneously with Liberia RISING 2030. The MPEA and the Governance Commission (GC), both of which have statutory mandates for long-term planning in the context of a national vision, served as the institutional anchors for Liberia RISING 203024. Liberia's development partners and a broad range of civil society actors also supported these efforts. This chapter describes the process of developing Liberia RISING 2030 and the AfT, which is the first of several medium term plans to operationalize the National Vision.

5.2 THE NATIONAL VISION:

LIBERIA RISING 2030  The exercise of developing the National Vision began as a concept note for long-term planning. Since this was the first such exercise in Liberia, the highest level of political buy-in was necessary, and was achieved through a Cabinet endorsement of the concept note. Further, initial consultations were held with stakeholders representing a broad spectrum of Liberian society. Political party leaders, youth and student groups, religious groups, civil society organizations (CSOs), government agencies, private sector and development partners, among others, were included in the consultations. The National Vision task force and secretariat were established in February 2011, and undertook a retrospective and structural analysis to identify critical actors, trends, and dynamics in Liberia's recent history.

From the initial consultations to the development of the study, what emerged was the desire to transform Liberia into a middle-income country with equal opportunities and access to all by the year 2030. A

National Vision Steering Committee, consisting of eminent Liberian citizens from various parts of the country, provided oversight to the process and promoted dialogue among all stakeholders in order to build consensus on a shared vision. Using the findings from the retrospective and structural analysis, several scenarios of possible futures for Liberia were constructed. The baseline studies, including the retrospective analysis and the scenarios, were taken to the Liberian people in nationwide consultations. Regional conferences were used to announce the findings of the studies; district consultations discussed the findings of the retrospective analysis and scenarios, and were followed by strategy formulation.

5.3 MEDIUM-TERM GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY (AFT)- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

Developing Liberia's medium-term growth strategy required intense intra-sectoral and cross-sectoral coordination to ensure that the process benefited from synergies and complementarities among sectors. It was vital to ensure that various actors (partners and government) within each sector had a shared understanding of the challenges and opportunities within their own sector, as well as the linkages between their work and those of others across sectors. To achieve this level of cooperation, 25 sector working groups (SWGs) analyzed and formulated sector plans. Each SWG followed a common results-focused approach, emphasizing outcomes and capacity development, rather than the output-focused approach as was done in the Lift Liberia PRS. The SWGs were led by government ministries, agencies, and commissions (MACs) and co-led by one development partner designated for each sector. The SWGs analyzed sector-specific plans and strategies and used other relevant information as inputs to develop a results framework. A participatory process was used to formulate clear goals, strategic objectives, agents of change, intermediate outcomes, and priority interventions to be included in the medium-term strategy. There was special attention to identify the roles of non-state actors who could work with the relevant state actors as agents of change. Each SWG articulated one vision/goal statement, from which the pillar goals were developed. Each sector's goals were consistent with the broader goals of the National Vision. In addition, the SWGs prepared monitoring plans that included measurable outcome indicators and targets to enable monitoring of progress toward the goals and outcome targets.

The SWGs delivered reports that were then consolidated to ensure that strategies in various sectors were coherent and mutually complementary. The SWG coordinators then reviewed the consolidated reports for validation and confirmation. If the representations were not considered fair, they were revisited and corrected, or justifications were made to the sectoral actors.

Another important aspect of the formulation process has been the alignment of the medium term expenditure framework with the AfT. In order to facilitate a strong linkage, the MTEF exercise formulated prioritization criteria (overall, and by sector) to guide the selection of the priority interventions, in line with a sound results chain. The overall prioritization criteria included:

1. Alignment of Results Framework (AfT goals, objectives, outcome indicators), and Budget Framework priorities, with a focus on "transformative" interventions;

2. Appropriateness of public-private-CSO sector roles and public-private partnerships

3. Potential socioeconomic benefits and synergies (based on available information, including economic returns, inclusive benefits, emerging benefits from PRS 1, synergies with other pillars/sub-pillars

4. Consideration for women, youth, persons with disabilities and other vulnerable groups)

5. Strength of stakeholder priorities/consensus (from PRS I, other)

6. Past performance and capacity of implementing agencies

7. Balance in recurrent and capital expenditures and in geographical allocations (vis-à-vis benefits).

To foster national consensus on a shared vision of national development, the Government built on the experience of the PRS to organize a comprehensive participatory consultative process held throughout the country. The Government also solicited and incorporated contributions from MACs, the Legislature, the Judiciary, donors, civil society and private sector. To avoid interfering with elections in the second half of 2011, consultations with the wider population were scheduled post-election. Because the growth strategy was developed in tandem with the National Vision, the major issues from the draft growth strategy report containing the sector plans and priorities were taken to nationwide consultations, together with the findings of the retrospective analysis and the possible scenarios from the National Vision exercise. The national consultations were held across all administrative districts (154 districts) in the country. This allowed the general population to participate in developing the national agenda. It also gave an opportunity to harness the reconciliation efforts ongoing in the country, especially after a charged election period. The relevant feedback from the consultations has been incorporated in this document. Annex 3 summarizes some of the key themes/messages arising from the consultations. Figure 2 illustrates the framework used for formulating the results framework and the linkages with the various components and implied results chain underlying the AfT. Further details on the linkages with the monitoring plan are contained in Chapter 15.

CHAPTER 6. EXPERIENCES AND LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE LIFT LIBERIA POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY (PRS)

6.1 INTRODUCTION

Four pillars guided the Lift Liberia PRS of 2008-2011: (a) Peace and Security; (b) Economic Revitalization; (c) Governance and Rule of Law; and (d) Infrastructure and Basic Services. The program delivered more than 400 outputs and met two-thirds of its goals. Peace was sustained; economic growth continued, especially in urban areas; poverty declined; some physical infrastructure was improved; coverage of health and education services was expanded on most measures; and various aspects of governance improved. However, many of the PRS deliverables comprised preparatory measures such as devising detailed strategies and plans; building capacity; formulating policies and passing laws; and building or rebuilding parts of institutional and physical/infrastructural systems. Although these developments are undeniably encouraging, the outputs did not achieve all of the desired outcomes of the PRS.

This chapter describes the lessons learned from the process of the PRS (with attention to results as well as deliverables) about how to prioritize interventions and achieve quick wins. Lessons from the PRS show the need for more attention to coordination and capacity development (institutional, human, financial capacity) to achieve all of its goals. The final section of this chapter details a number of principles that have been internalized into the AfT as a result of these lessons learned.

6.2 SUMMARY OF LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE

LIFT LIBERIA

PRS

A recent review of the accomplishments of the PRS25 shows many "fully satisfactory" outcomes, including maintaining macroeconomic stability with low inflation; a balanced budget; and the reduction of external debt. Outcomes were "partly satisfactory" in the sectors of health, water and sanitation, the business and private sectors, and civil service reform. There were also areas in which outcomes were "marginally positive," including the transition of security to Liberian agencies; delivery of basic education; improvement of roads; environmental issues; labor protection; and crime prevention. Finally, in a few areas-electric power supply, prompt delivery of justice, and decentralization-outcomes were "unsatisfactory," indicating the need for more attention and a revised strategy. The disappointing outcomes, despite the majority of deliverables completed, indicate a need to rethink the strategy.

While the PRS met a large number of deliverable targets, it sometimes failed to deliver visible results to Liberian citizens. Meanwhile, the anxiety and expectations of the citizenry have grown while the pressures on government to deliver immediate results and dividends of peace have increased. The AfT recognizes the urgency to deliver quick and tangible changes in the lives of Liberians, and incorporates the following important lessons from the PRS:

Focus more on results-not just deliverables-and delve deeper into underlying factors that constrain or enable results: While the attention on deliverables is important, in order to facilitate accountability and short-term monitoring, the primary focus should be on development results. It is important to complement

25 An evaluation of the PRS, Lift Liberia Poverty Reduction Strategy: Final Report - A Results-Focused Assessment, was carried out in September 2011 by an independent international expert, working in close collaboration with senior staff from the Ministry of Planning and Economic Development.

a focus on processes with outcome-based thinking for at least two reasons. First, a focus on outcomes helps to inform the choice of deliverables-so they fit together and ensure that Liberia's priorities are achieved. Thinking through the results chain that leads to both the priority outcomes and relevant intermediate milestones ensures that the planning and annual budget processes take a more systematic account of such cross-sectoral linkages. Second, defining measurable outcomes in addition to deliverables facilitates M&E, which helps to identify critical problems and allows for midterm adjustments as necessary to ensure that the outcomes are achieved.

Monitoring and evaluation: The M&E system should be more robust and focus on outcomes that are in line with a results-focus approach. Baselines, targets, and measureable indicators must be agreed upon in advance and tracked. Further, proactive management reviews and guidance should support M&E in coordination effectiveness.

Prioritize interventions and complement strategy with realistic financing plans: The development strategy and proposed programs/interventions must be carefully prioritized and complement an explicit and realistic financing plan and overall public expenditure budget. During the PRS, especially in the first two years, a serious gap existed between the strategic agenda and available financing. Aligning national budget allocations and external funding for the ambitious PRS programs/outputs would have increased the success rates. The Government's introduction of the 2012 MTEF has helped align the strategy and budget in the AfT.

Align stakeholder actions across sectors and pillars: Cross-pillar and cross-sector coordination needs more attention. The PRS showed that shortcomings in one sector are often interrelated with shortcomings from another. For example, shortcomings in the availability of roads and electricity contributed to the difficulty of achieving targets in a variety of other sectors, especially agriculture, small business development, and social service delivery (education, health, sanitation). Problems with formalizing land rights and ownership held back progress in agricultural and business development. Stronger cross-sectoral policy coordination within the Government and with private sector counterparts, combined with stronger alignment with donor assistance, should lead to better results.

6.3 IMPLICATIONS FOR THE AGENDA FOR TRANSFORMATION

The lessons learned during the implementation of the PRS, coupled with various studies, strategies, and review missions, all serve to inform the AfT. The transformation agenda seeks to overcome the shortcomings of the PRS by being tightly results-focused, strategic, and catalytic, so as to transform the national economy in a way that allows ordinary Liberians begin to experience, in a more tangible way, the benefits of inclusive growth and development.

• This strategy builds on the gains made and lessons learned from the Lift Liberia PRS;

- This strategy is more results-focused and highlights institutional constraints on both demand and supply sides that need to be addressed to achieve national goals;

- This strategy recognizes that internal and external funding needs to be allocated for each program / project and completely aligned to the prioritized desired results;

- This strategy embeds coordination and capacity development throughout as a critical component in achieving transformational change and advancing results; sectoral strategies, which have been discussed with various stakeholders;

- This strategy benefits from a retrospective analysis of Liberia's past;

- This strategy benefits from discussions of a High Level Economic Forum that brought together key policymakers, development partners, international experts, and private citizens to review all major analytical studies on Liberia and to explore the strategic options for Liberia as we envision a middle income country where growth is inclusive and development is sustainable;

- The strategy also benefits from extensive national consultations and validations performed as part of the Vision 2030, in which thousands of Liberian citizens from a variety of economic strata and geographic regions participated and expressed their desires for what they wish to see in the future of the county;

• This strategy recognizes that the achievement of middle income status by 2030 is possible but that GDP growth is not a panacea to Liberia's development challenges;

- This strategy addresses the socio-political dimensions of growth and development;

- This strategy recognizes the importance of security to growth and development;

- This strategy acknowledges that growth can have a significant impact on reducing inequality; however, that this effect can be amplified through policy measures focused on growing inclusiveness;

- This strategy recognizes that Liberia's growth needs to be endogenous and that Liberia's domestic tax base needs to be expanded;

• This strategy recognizes that Liberia should not attempt to address all shortcomings at once but acknowledges the need to prioritize investment. One or two key constraints should be identified, prioritized and removed, while also addressing other important, but second level constraints;

- This strategy acknowledges that major investments in infrastructure (energy, roads, information communications technology [ICT]) are necessary to unlocking growth but a conscious effort should be taken to ensure inclusiveness in their provision;

- This strategy recognizes that investment in energy, to unlock the urban economy, has the greatest return on investment and should be prioritized;

- This strategy recognizes that investments in human development (education, health and social protection) should be prioritized so as to address capacity and inclusiveness;

• This strategy recognizes the importance of the private sector and civil society and that coordination among government and various actors are critical if Liberia is to achieve its development goals;

• This strategy recognizes that the concession economy will continue to be the major driver of economic growth in the short term but that it requires a different model of administration than in the past;

- This strategy recognizes that natural resource rents MUST be managed properly to prevent "resource curse" or "Dutch disease" and to ensure that local communities benefit; growth is to benefit all and lead to true development;

- This strategy recognizes that Government needs to support small and medium enterprises (enabling policy regime, regulation, finance, etc.) as well as smallholder farmers (supporting roads, logistics, finance, etc.).

- This strategy recognizes that regulatory regimes need to be appropriate so that more informal sector businesses can move into the formal economy and so that local businesses can benefit from government procurement of goods and services.

With these principles in mind, the next chapter will summarize concisely the goals and the key objectives of the AfT as well as the structure of the strategy, which will be provided in full in Chapters 8 through 12 in Section III.

CHAPTER 7. OBJECTIVES AND STRUCTURE OF THE AGENDA FOR

TRANSFORMATION

7.1 INTRODUCTION

Development is incremental, and Liberia is no exception. With the AfT, the Government will focus on accelerating growth in order to achieve its vision of middle-income status by 2030. However, the goal is not only to further growth, but to also ensure that it can be sustained and ultimately lead to a more inclusive society. Thus, the strategy encompasses not only economic growth but also inclusion, equity, justice, peace, reconciliation, human development, and good governance.

This chapter outlines the objectives of the AfT and its structure, which will be supported by four main pillars: (a) Peace, Security and Rule of Law; (b) Economic Transformation; (c) Governance and Public Institutions; and (d) Human Development. A fifth pillar on Cross-Cutting Issues supports these core pillars.

7.2 OBJECTIVES OF THE AGENDA FOR TRANSFORMATION

The AfT builds on the gains made in the PRS and addresses the remaining constraints to growth so that Liberia can achieve middle-income status by 2030. Beyond income growth, this strategy also supports initiatives that allow a greater proportion of the population to share in the growth and experience better quality of life. Liberia's history and political economy of development demonstrates that economic growth alone is insufficient to bring about the transformation needed. Therefore, in addition to wealth creation, the second key objective is to increase inclusiveness for a more equal and just society. Three groups of outcome indicators will measure progress toward these objectives:

1. Per capita income and consumption measures: As discussed in Chapter 2, Liberia will need to average about 9 percent real GDP growth annually over the next 18 years to achieve the middle-income benchmark of US$1,000 per capita. Over the next five years, growth should meet this pace if present commodity price levels remain steady.

2. Millennium Development Goal (MDG) indicators.

3. Census indicators of unmet basic needs.

In order to achieve its overarching goal of wealth creation and poverty reduction, the AfT will focus, over the next five years, on achieving key objectives across four main pillars:

1. Peace, Security and Rule of Law

- Through determined, incremental change over the first five years, Liberia will continue to professionalize its security institutions (national army and law enforcement), equipping them to take over responsibility of security in Liberia and share leadership for security in the sub-region.

- The Government will strengthen reconciliation of various segments of Liberian society. It will invest in institutions that help manage cleavages and resolve conflicts in a peaceful manner (e.g., palaver huts programs) and address issues raised by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC). The nation will evaluate its symbols and narratives, recognizing the brutalities of the past and actively promoting reconciliation. While a single national identity is being built, public institutions will take care to achieve fair representation and to empower local and community organizations.

- Access to justice will be expanded; the credibility, transparency and operational efficiency of the Judiciary will be strengthened; commercial and traditional governance will be integrated into the formal justice system with clearly delimited responsibilities.

2. Infrastructure and Economic Transformation

- In order to transform and diversify the economy, one of the Government's key objectives is to improve infrastructure-including energy, roads and bridges, sea and air ports, post and telecommunications, public buildings and affordable housing. Together with strategic partners, the Government will continue to finance and assist in the procurement and management of infrastructure projects, including year-round power production and distribution; the rehabilitation of the Mount Coffee Hydro Plant; expanded access to piped water and sewer systems in high-density areas; and pavement of main roads.

- To transform the power sector and improve critical infrastructure, this strategy utilizes partnerships with donors, PPPs, appropriate investments in state-owned enterprises (SOE) and the Government, investments along development corridors, special economic zones (SEZ), regional partnerships, and other arrangements. Whenever feasible, infrastructure investments will be labor-intensive to provide jobs.

- The Government will also focus efforts on transforming and diversifying the domestic private sector. While activity in resource-based sectors will be encouraged, the Government will also encourage the growth and formalization of MSMEs, and remove constraints affecting them, including constraints related to infrastructure, finance, skills, regulation and property rights.

- The Government will pay particular attention to improving the results of the smallholder agricultural, fishing and forestry sectors. It will work to increase agricultural productivity, access to markets, and availability of intermediate inputs for these sectors, with the objective of furthering local food security and exports.

- The Government will seek to promote the growth of Liberian exports, employing export processing zones, improved trade agreements, and better customs regimes.

- Started in the PRS, conservative macroeconomic management and consistent, incremental improvements in fiscal, monetary and banking policies will be continued and strengthened.

3. Human Development

- The Government will work to assure equitable access to free basic education for all children and youth. It will also focus on improving the quality of basic education by soliciting greater community involvement and oversight, as well as increasing the training of teachers.

- Liberian youth are the country's most valuable asset. Thus, a key objective is to develop skills among youth that make them increasingly employable and productive. Investments in technical and vocational education, as well as other secondary and tertiary education, can ensure that Liberians have the skills to respond to job opportunities, including those arising from foreign investment. Investments that nurture business acumen, managerial training, and entrepreneurship skills will equip people with the capabilities to create their own small businesses.

- Investments will be made to increase access to and use of health, family planning, and social welfare services, especially for vulnerable populations.

- The Government will continue its tradition of partnering with donors, the private sector, religious institutions, community-based organizations and NGOs to provide decentralized delivery and oversight of education and health care services. Incentives will be aligned to encourage and reward good performance.

- The Government will work to increase access to safe water supplies, sanitation and waste management, and to improve hygiene practices, including for the poorest and most vulnerable communities.

4. Governance and Public Institutions

- The Government will recast its relationship with citizens, and all government functions will be geared to provide services to the population.

- The Government will engage with citizens to (a) build and operate responsive democratic institutions at national and local levels; and (b) strengthen good governance and peace-building. Decentralization will start with "de-concentration" to localize the provision of essential government services in each county and strengthen the role of local organizations and leaders in deciding investment priorities and monitoring outputs.

- The Government will continue to enhance civil service and strengthen government institutions. Employment in the public sector will be based on merit, and various groups of society will be fairly represented in politics at the national and local levels.

- To maximize resources available for the public good, the Government will enhance economic governance by building institutional capacity of revenue-oriented ministries to ensure that revenues are managed, monitored, and used for the development of Liberia.

- Institutions such as LEITI and the new National Bureau of Concessions will monitor compliance under fiscal and non-fiscal obligations of concessionaires, and encourage development of linkages with the local economy. Revenues received and expenditures made will be audited and made public. Institutions to monitor compliance and punish corruption and violations will be strengthened.

- The Government will continue efforts under the PRS to clarify rights and responsibilities of stakeholders with regard to land ownership, and simplify the land administration and management systems.

- Institutions that oversee and promote government transparency and accountability will be strengthened, with a particular focus on lessening corruption at all levels.

Overarching goal-achieve greater inclusiveness: Instability and conflict remain the primary risk to long-term wealth creation in Liberia. To minimize this risk, the Government must include all citizens in the growth process and give them a stake in ensuring stability. The challenge will be to turn away from the traditional practice of concentrating wealth and power in the elite and in Monrovia. To do so, the Government will strive to meet the following objectives:

Generate economic opportunities with a special focus on rural areas, youth and women: Productive employment is an unquestionable avenue toward raising people out of poverty and giving them a stake in development. While the Government can provide a small share of manual employment through public works projects, the majority of jobs must be generated through higher-productivity agricultural activities and MSMEs. The Government will support such job creation by implementing strategies for the development of agriculture; by increasing focus on practical skills and vocational education programs; and by expanding infrastructure, electricity and ICT throughout the country. A special focus will be on job creation for youth and women, who are currently underrepresented in formal employment, in order to empower them to be full participants in all aspects of Liberian society.

Continue to increase access to education, especially in rural areas and among girls: Educated citizens are more likely to escape poverty; educated mothers have lower levels of fertility and children with better development outcomes. The Government has implemented a policy of free and compulsory basic education; however, more effort is needed to ensure that these services reach distant rural areas and that achievement among boys and girls are equalized. Therefore, the Government will continue to broaden access and improve quality of public and private education.

Institute social safety nets: While the Government will make all efforts to improve the opportunities available to citizens, it will also seek to institute safety nets for those at high risk for sliding into poverty-especially persons with disabilities and at-risk children.

Broaden and deepen provision of services: Beyond efficiency, the Government must be more responsive and seek to equalize opportunities across counties. One way is to apply the taxes generated from natural resource activities across all counties to improve infrastructure and government services. Government must also strive to make policies that will cater, not only to formal business but also to the many Liberians in the informal sector.

7.3 THE STRUCTURE OF THE AGENDA FOR TRANSFORMATION

The four pillars-Peace, Security and the Rule of Law; Economic Transformation; Human Development, and Governance and Public Institutions-represent the core foundations for generating wealth and inclusive growth; the fifth cross-cutting pillar summarizes critical issues that need to be taken into consideration in all other pillars. Each pillar contains a number of sub-pillars, as shown in Figure 7.1. The core of the strategy is detailed in Chapters 8 through 12 and addresses each of these pillars-stating the overall goal, each sub-pillar and its goal, the current constraints to reaching these goals, and the objectives across each sub-pillar that are designed to address these constraints. The description of the change process and the agents of change, the outcome indicators and the priority interventions are also discussed. Each chapter closes with a summary of the goals, objectives and outcome indicators.

The pillars are mutually reinforcing, and progress in one area will facilitate progress in another. For example, peace and security and the rule of law are prerequisites for sustained economic transformation. Likewise, peace and national security will be threatened if governance and public institutions do not deliver on their promise of transparency, inclusiveness and fairness. Sustainable peace also depends on the ability to create inclusive economic opportunities and deliver basic social services throughout the country. On the other hand, the ability to achieve economic transformation will depend on meeting targets of human development. Basic infrastructure is required for broad-based growth and delivery of services nationwide and also provides the basis for decentralized governance systems. Governance and the rule of law provide the institutional base for strong economic performance as well as the justice needed to ensure that grievances are settled within the political system and not through violence. The linkages between the

pillars are numerous-and progress across all is required to achieve inclusive wealth creation.

CHAPTER 8. PILLAR I-PEACE, SECURITY AND RULE OF LAW

Liberia today enjoys a level of peace and security that it has not seen in three decades. The nation's past has shown how the vicious cycle of poverty, marginalization, and inequity can drive conflict and further poverty, but this cycle has been broken over the last eight years of peace. Ongoing social and economic development and the quality of life of all Liberians depend on safeguarding and continuing to strengthen the peace and security the country currently enjoys. In fact, the achievement of the goals within this strategy depends on the continuation of Liberia's current trajectory toward a safer society.

Goal: Create an atmosphere of peaceful co-existence based on reconciliation and conflict resolution, and provide security, access to justice, and rule of law to all.

The Government will continue to address the key sources of conflict and insecurity, protect the citizens of Liberia from violence and crime, deliver justice and uphold the rule of law, reconcile all Liberian people and together build a more peaceful and more secure nation. Recognizing the strong interrelationship among poverty, unemployment, lack of investor confidence, crime, justice, insecurity and conflict, the Government will also use this Agenda for Transformation to coordinate all activities for peace and security into one development framework. This strategy recognizes that food insecurity, economic and health insecurity, and political ostracism-especially of volatile youth-can cause crime, violence and political instability. The Government will protect Liberians from these types of insecurities, while emphasizing the importance of human rights, good governance, and access to economic opportunities, education, and health care for all, as discussed in chapters 9 through 12.

The prevalence of conflict and crime in recent years has decreased in actuality as well as in stakeholder perceptions. The perceptions of police and judicial fairness and access to justice are also more favorable, but still need much improvement. Though the threat of an armed conflict has declined, crimes such as armed robbery, rape, and vigilantism still threaten individual and community security (Liberia PRS Assessment, 2011, p. 12-13).

Notwithstanding broad-based efforts at reform, Liberians' experience with security and justice remains marred in some cases by arbitrary arrest and detention, harsh prison conditions, and prolonged pretrial detention. These denials of due process continue alongside isolated reports of ritual killings, mob violence, and certain customary justice practices that violate human rights. The impact of these failures is aggravated by substandard practices such as judicial inefficiency, corruption, and the limitation of true reconciliation across society, which remains one of the greatest threats to Liberia's long-term peace and stability.

Key challenges to achieving these goals include:

• Operational inefficiencies of Liberian security agencies, caused by a lack of human capacity, insufficient coordination across the sector, and the centralization of justice and security provision in and around Monrovia.

• Endemic corruption, the culture of impunity, and the lack of accountability that still plague the sector and undermine the integrity and credibility of legal, justice and security institutions.

• The time pressure and resource gap created by the anticipated withdrawal of the United Nations

Mission, which is still the main security provider in Liberia.

Overcoming these challenges will require the commitment of political and social leaders; significant increases in domestic financing for the budget; changes in long-established social norms and values; enhanced participation across society and especially from marginalized groups such as women, children and youth; and the creation of mechanisms and motivation for Liberians to demand accountability. None of these things are easy and all will require difficult decisions and trade-offs. True peace and security are outcomes of a social contract between citizens and the state in which both sides have rights and responsibilities.

The AfT sets out goals for each of the four sectors within Pillar I: Security, Peace and Reconciliation, Justice and Rule of Law, and Judicial Reform. Achieving these goals will better protect Liberians against crime, violence and corruption; further, public confidence in justice and the rule of law will grow as basic rights are protected. Everyone, including marginalized groups such as women and youth, will participate in decision making in a free and fair society. These peace and security goals will also help Liberia to achieve the broader peace building and state building goals set out in the New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States.

As Liberia transitions from cultivating to maintaining peace and security, it will enhance social development and economic opportunity, making all Liberians feel more secure. Key elements in achieving these objectives are summarized in Table 8.2.

Table 8.1: Sector Goals for Peace and Security

A. SECURITY: Maintain a secured and safe environment to enable sustainable socio-economic growth and development.

B. PEACE AND RECONCILIATION: Ensure long-term peace and stability through managing tensions in society to reduce the risk of future conflict, increasing social cohesion and ensuring that the principles of human rights are upheld.

C. JUSTICE AND RULE OF LAW: Build the effectiveness and integrity of legal institutions, increase equitable access to justice and strengthen the rule of law for the social and economic benefit of all Liberians.

D. JUDICIAL REFORM: Protect the rights and dignity of all through a strengthened, credible and independent Judiciary delivering transparent justice.

Key cross-cutting issues of relevance to Pillar I include gender equality, child protection, youth empowerment, human rights, and labor and employment. These issues are integrated throughout this chapter and are elaborated in Chapter 12.

8.1 SECURITY

Liberia's security has improved. Ten years ago, security forces intimidated and terrorized the population, intervened in political processes, and disregarded the rule of law. Today, the police force, armed forces, and all other security forces are being restored into professional and capable institutions. Through the first PRS, the Government exerted immense efforts to effectively address the negative attributes of the security sector, such as the absence of accountability, weak oversight, gross abuse of human rights, lack of professionalism, inadequate resources, lack of good governance, and the absence of strategies and programs for the sector. Building on these efforts, the focus is now on sustaining and augmenting progress made in creating a secure environment, and continuing to build viable national security structures that are responsive to the security needs of the Liberian population.

Goal: Maintain a secure and safe environment to enable sustainable socioeconomic growth and development.

Constraints: Liberian security agencies have yet to demonstrate that they will be ready to fully take over the domestic security functions from the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) upon its departure. The civilian security services have significant operational inefficiencies and limited capacities, and national defense institutions have limited ability to respond to external threats. Inadequate institutional arrangements within the security sector inhibit proper and prompt functioning. Further, legitimacy is lacking in a few instances due to the absence of appropriate policies and legal framework to underpin the required reforms. A multiplicity of actors, insufficient budgetary support, and inadequate coordination undermine the ability of the sector to deliver security services. The public and civil society do not hold the security services accountable, and the absence of civilian oversight, consultation and communication create distrust in civilian-security relations.

Strategic objectives: The first objective is to maintain the current security situation and the nation's territorial integrity and ensure their sustainability during and after the process of UNMIL withdrawal. Presently, the general population enjoys security protection largely dependent on UNMIL resources and expertise. During the five years of the AfT, UNMIL will transfer most, if not all, of the responsibilities for providing security to the Liberian Government. The new Liberian security architecture will be consolidated and able to assume this responsibility. Given the importance of this process, the Liberian security sector will require considerable financial and technical support in order to facilitate a smooth transition.

This will require increasing operational effectiveness; reducing corrupt practices of the Liberian security agencies; building synergy between the security and justice sectors; and more effectively coordinating donor aid to the security sector. Achieving these objectives will contribute to the third objective of increasing the accountability and legitimacy of national security institutions and the public's confidence in them.

Agents and process for change: Many domestic and international agencies carry out security functions in Liberia, each with a different area of focus. Some of these allocations will change as the UNMIL transitions out of the country from 2012 to 2017. The ultimate arbiter of allocating responsibility is the National Security Council (NSC). In areas where the Liberian security agencies currently have full responsibility, such as firefighting, this will continue. In areas where UNMIL has a large role at present, the corresponding Liberian agencies will present strategic transition plans, which the NSC will review for inter-agency compatibility.

The Liberia National Police (LNP), the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) under the Ministry of Defense (MOD) and other domestic security forces will continue to expand their capacity and lead role, assuming more responsibility from UNMIL. The AFL will implement measures, identified during the 150 Days Action Plan of President Sirleaf's second term, to reduce high turnover. The NSC, reporting directly to the Executive Mansion, will work with UNMIL and Liberian security agencies to ensure continued and improved security during the transition. Active Civilian Oversight Boards (COBs) will provide meaningful accountability of all national security institutions.

The Executive Protection Services (EPS) will develop and implement a strategic plan; the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) will be fundamentally reformed and develop a National Drug Prevention and Protection Strategy to curtail the proliferation and trafficking of illicit and dangerous drugs through Liberia's territories. The Liberia National Fire Service (LNFS) will develop and implement a National Fire Prevention and Protection Strategy. The Bureau of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Customs and Excise, the Maritime Police, Liberia Sea Port Police, the Liberia Anti-Corruption Commission (LACC) investigating unit, and the Monrovia City Police will all be reformed to align with the National Security Strategy of Liberia.

Outcome indicators (by end 2017): Current levels of security will continue after the UNMIL peacekeeping mission leaves. Crime rates will have declined. Statistics on illegal entry and smuggling will show improved security of international borders and entry points; fewer unlicensed small arms and light weapons will be in circulation outside of official security force; surveys will show increased access to and public confidence in security services in all regions of Liberia.

Priority interventions: Many rural Liberians already express a preference for national providers of security (especially the police) over international ones, reflecting the progress made toward the objectives outlined above. To build on this success, the Government will create an enabling national security framework to (a) regulate and coordinate municipal, corporate, concessional private, and other investigative security related institutions; (b) strengthen domestic, regional and international cooperation; and (c) engage constructively with member states of Mano River Union, ECOWAS, and the African Union (AU) to support lasting peace in the region and curtail transnational organized crime. Civilian Oversight Boards will increase oversight of national security agencies to strengthen community relations and increase community participation in security matters. Laws and policies to address key security issues such as gun control will be implemented and the presence of security forces across Liberia will be increased using regional justice and security hubs.

To increase public confidence in the security forces, the Government will recruit qualified security personnel via transparent and equitable vetting processes to reflect Liberia's diverse ethnic, gender and religious population, and train personnel in line with international standards to promote accountability, ethical behavior, and professional conduct under democratic civilian control.

In the wake of the UNMIL transition, the Government will improve strategic planning and medium-term budgeting processes, with sustainability plans to manage recurring costs, develop human and institutional capacity, invest in necessary logistics and infrastructure, and improve salaries and incentives.

Specific to the police force, the LNP will:

• Expand the pilot program, launched during the 150 Days, to attract better quality officers to the police force and increase public confidence in the police. Train and equip an additional 1,500 officers; increase the overall strength of LNP, including backfilling vacancies created when raising Emergency Response Unit (500) and Police Support Unit (1,000). This increase will enable higher visibility in communities and increased capacity to respond to serious incidents and violent crimes.

• Expand and strengthen Women and Child Protection Units.

• Significantly increase salaries for LNP officers and personnel to meet their basic needs, to improve performance and productivity and decrease corruption in the service.26

• Provide additional mobility equipment to improve police response time and visibility; and link police facilities and patrols via improved communications, including links between LNP command structures and 911 lines to increase access to the police service during emergencies. A maintenance and usage-monitoring strategy will be developed to guard against unwanted use and depreciation of police equipment.

• Develop community policing; hold regular community-security forums in every county; support community watch teams and regular police foot patrols in communities.

The Armed Forces of Liberia will:

• Be restructured to undertake at least two missions simultaneously.

• Recruit, train and equip 350 soldiers to strengthen the Liberia National Coast Guard to police Liberia's territorial waters and Exclusive Economic Zone against illegal fishing and other illegal activities as well as conduct search and rescue missions.

• Increase the Engineering Company to battalion size to contribute to development through its enhanced Military Aid to Civil Authority program.

• Increase territorial defense with wider nationwide deployment, increased protection for territorial waters, and an operational Military Response Center.

• Raise salaries, renovate barracks, and provide communication equipment and other hardware to enable operational readiness, improve health care services, and build court-martial capacity.

The Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization (BIN) will rationalize, augment, and enhance the effectiveness of the force through structural reform, including the following actions:

• Train and equip officers, including armed Special Border Patrol Unit officers, to manage effectively the 36 official border posts of Liberia.

• Develop a National Border Management Strategy to ensure that Liberia's land, sea and air borders are effectively managed by all relevant agencies.

• Provide increased salaries, logistics, communication and office equipment, infrastructure and accommodation to increase performance and productivity of BIN officers.

8.2 PEACE AND RECONCILIATION

Reconciliation remains an indispensable goal for cultivating

and protecting Liberia's fragile peace. The civil war opened and

exacerbated social cleavages that must be bridged-inter-tribal

tensions must be resolved, and economic, social and political

exclusion and marginalization must be addressed. The goal of

this development strategy is to increase the equity and fairness

necessary to build prolonged peace.

Over the last six years, the Government has been committed to

establishing a lasting and durable peace by addressing root

causes of conflict-the conflict factors-in the country while

also increasing social, economic and legal justice to reduce the risk of further conflict and build a stable democracy. It has implemented numerous programs for

achieving stable and sustainable peace, and strengthening capacity to manage and resolve conflict. Peace-

building initiatives have tackled a range of sectors, factors and attitudes, seeking to strengthen national

and local capacities; change attitudes and promote reconciliation; and develop and disseminate conflict-

sensitive approaches toward reform throughout Liberia.

Despite these advancements, intra-communal cohesion and trust-both important indicators of

reconciliation-are still lacking to some extent. Some communities remain fragmented, and perceptions

of entitlement and legitimacy are often distorted. Reform and conflict resolution mechanisms at local and

national levels do not adequately address inter-ethnic, inter-religious and inter-generational tensions over

Box 8.0: Costed Priority Security Sector Interventions

• Install Civilian Oversight Boards for all security agencies

• Develop and implement action plans for the LNP for transition of military and civilian functions from UNMIL

• Develop and implement action plans for the BIN for transition of military and civilian functions from UNMIL

• Increase LNP salaries, institute more attractive group insurance policy, implement pension and retirement policy

• Establish Police College

• Equip military with required transportation, communications equipment and hardware

• Construct, resource and operationalize five Regional Security Hubs

• Renovation of camp Todee Military facility

• Renovation of Camp Naama, Bong County

• Develop and implement action plans for BCR for transition of military and civilian functions from UNMIL

• Acquire land, construct and furnish BIN barracks zones/depots in counties throughout Liberia natural resource management and long-term secure access to land. These remain critical challenges to peace and reconciliation.

Youth leadership in peace-building and development initiatives at the community level has been strong, and requires support to continue the momentum that these youth have established. Most peace-building activities continue to depend heavily on international actors for finance and implementation.

Goal: To ensure long-term peace and stability through managing tensions in society to reduce the risk of future conflict, increasing social cohesion and ensuring that the principles of human rights are upheld. Constraints: True peace-building and reconciliation cannot be achieved through government efforts alone-it requires a multifaceted approach throughout all elements of society and must grow organically over time. One challenge is the current lack of consensus on the definition, mandate, methodology and approach to sustainable peace and reconciliation. Further, current conflict prevention efforts will need to be better coordinated, with more emphasis placed on local resolution processes. Another challenge is the divisive historical identities that underpin ongoing social cleavages in Liberia-genuine opportunities to participate in peace-building, reconciliation, and political processes must be created for everyone, particularly marginalized groups such as unemployed youth and women. The political system at various levels must continue to develop and mature so that political parties can work together and demonstrate multipartite commitment to advance dialogue and joint action for reconciliation and peace-building. For true sustainable peace-building, real progress must be made in implementing the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC). True reconciliation in Liberia is currently hindered by inadequate accountability for human rights violations committed during the civil war-something that still needs to be addressed.

Strategic objectives: The Government will engage civil society and all partners to support the most critical transformation in the country's history-from a fragile post-conflict nation uncomfortable with its past to a stable, unified nation with a vibrant future. Current political, social and institutional barriers to reconciliation will be broken down to enable effective peace-building. Interpersonal reconciliation will be strengthened through community-level conflict prevention and resolution, with a focused effort on engaging marginalized groups, particularly dispossessed youth. Government agencies at national and subnational levels will strengthen their capacity for conflict management through training, conflict analysis and research. Accountability will be increased and impunity decreased, and Liberians will enjoy a shared positive national identity.

Agents and process for change: The Government and the Independent National Human Rights Commission (INHRC), with strong support from the Governance Commission, the National Reconciliation Task Force (launched during the 150 Days), political parties, religious groups, traditional and community leaders, civil society, and the media will establish a forum for interactive dialogue between the relevant political actors and social groups. This will decrease the possibility that the process becomes politicized and ensure consensus and a common commitment to support policy and strategy on key issues. The Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA) will assure that the INHRC and Governance Commission initiate and complete the agenda above, working with the other organizations to foster national unity.

Outcome indicators (by end 2017): By the end of 2017, peace will continue to prevail across Liberia, with fewer incidents of organized violence or community conflicts that escalate to violence. Communities will have the skills to resolve conflict without violence. Surveys will show that more Liberians understand their commonality, and shared history will be taught in all schools. Issues raised in the TRC report will be resolved, as evidenced in surveys, and marginalized groups (particularly unemployed youth) will be constructively engaged in society, as evidenced by voting and employment data.

Priority interventions: Measures to ensure strategic long-term peace-building and reconciliation include the following: Develop and implement a National Peace-building and Reconciliation Strategy that follows from a Reconciliation Roadmap. Strengthen institutional support and ensure sustainable funding for effective peace-building programs, while simultaneously improving coordination of activities and developing a consistent, intensive approach to managing conflicts-avoiding duplication and inconsistency, reducing gaps and promoting synergies. Establish alternative dispute resolution mechanisms-that include traditional chiefs-to handle land and civil disputes and to establish clear, enforceable guidelines for managing disputes that escalate into violence. Establish and fund the national Palaver Huts program, which was launched in the 150 Days, at county and regional levels across Liberia to strengthen local dispute resolution practices through truth-telling and a high level of participation by the general public. Establish reliable baseline information and progress indicators to monitor and evaluate outcomes and impact.

Through interventions outlined in Pillar 4 (Governance), the Government will also pursue political reconciliation and procedural justice. It will ensure (a) fair and equitable treatment in making and implementing decisions and compromise; and (b) inclusivity in the sharing of power, responsibility and resources. Under Pillar 2, Government efforts will support the delivery of economic justice, supporting a fairer distribution of wealth and opportunities and creating more employment opportunities, particularly for youth populations. Under Pillar 3, education and the eradication of illiteracy will also reduce the risk for conflict.

8.3 JUSTICE AND RULE OF LAW

Since the civil war, Liberia has made progress in re-establishing the rule of law and increasing access to justice. Institutional and legislative reform and human capacity development have strengthened the effectiveness and integrity of legal and judicial institutions and helped protect human rights. However, more progress is needed, and the Law Reform Commission has been reviewing the formal and traditional laws.

Corruption continues to be a major concern, and the population's perception of the justice system remains poor. While improvements have been made to court infrastructure, many courts remain housed in sub-standard facilities and

Box 8.1: Costed

Priority Peace and Reconciliation Sector Interventions

• Establish forum for Liberians of diverse backgrounds to discuss issues of national history, symbols and identity, reconciliation

• Implement the Palava Hut program including recommendations on relevant structures

• Ensure that land appropriation and tenure do not disadvantage marginalized groups lack basic equipment. Although the fight against the trafficking in persons has been furthered through an Act of Legislature that criminalizes human trafficking throughout the Republic of Liberia, concrete actions need be taken to demonstrate Liberia's resolve in the global fight against human trafficking.

Administrative policies and practices remain inconsistent and ad-hoc, including record keeping and case management. Case backlog in courts is high and the length of pretrial detention remains excessive. Justice agencies need to revamp their human resource and performance management systems; create clear and transparent recruitment procedures; introduce performance standards and a performance appraisal system; and build staff capacity.

An effective justice system is vital to addressing Liberia's most significant security threat-the growth in crime. Effective justice is also essential to economic revitalization because it can provide a framework for resolving contractual and property disputes, increasing commercial certainty, and promoting private sector growth. Efforts to defeat corruption also depend on effective action through the courts, and more equal access to justice will decrease social marginalization.

Liberia's Justice and Rule of Law sector includes prosecutors, public defenders, legal aid practitioners, and corrections officials. It also includes the court, of course, which the next section discusses in detail. Institutions such as the Louis Arthur Grimes School of Law, the James A.A. Pierre Judicial Institute, the Liberia National Bar Association, and the Liberian National Police Training Academy play a major role in shaping the direction and effectiveness of the country's legal system. Traditional justice providers, such as tribal and village chiefs, also play an important role in the arbitration of disputes. To extend the rule of law nationally, linkages among these institutions will be strengthened.

Goal: Build the effectiveness and integrity of legal institutions, to increase equitable access to justice and to strengthen the rule of law for the social and economic benefit of all Liberians.

Constraints: Access to justice is limited by inadequate capacity and inefficiencies in laws, practices, and

procedures that inhibit the proper and prompt functioning of the justice sector. It is also restricted by the

limited understanding of legal rights and responsibilities among the Liberian public. Even when Liberians

possess knowledge of the law, they do not always seek out formal justice because the time and cost

involved are perceived to outweigh the potential benefits of engagement with the system. Vulnerable and

marginalized groups face particular barriers-and women and their families suffer emotionally, socially

and economically because of inadequate capacity for the prevention of and response to gender issues. As

these situations persist, rule of law is undermined by inconsistencies maintained through the dual justice

system in which conflicting traditional and statutory systems of law exist in parallel. Compounding these

issues, incidences of misconduct, corruption and lack of accountability undermine the effectiveness,

integrity and credibility of the justice system.

Strategic objectives: The Government will increase equitable access to justice, particularly for remote and marginalized populations. The operational quality, efficiency and integrity of the justice system will be improved, corruption will be reduced, the formal statutory rule of law will be strengthened, and the cost of using it reduced. Public confidence in the justice system and fair rule of law will be increased by strengthening accountability and reducing the incidence of misconduct, corruption, and unprofessionalism.

Agents and process for change: The Ministry of Justice (MoJ), in consultation with the Judiciary and MIA,

will coordinate efforts with the Law Reform Commission, the Liberian National Bar Association, LACC

and the Judicial Inquiry Commission, traditional leaders and civil society. The Judiciary will collaborate

with the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) to plan the expansion and upgrading of court facilities in under-

served areas, and will collaborate with the MoJ to improve case management and record keeping. The MIA

will lead a consultation process on recommendations from the Law Reform Commission, and the legislature

will pass laws needed to harmonize traditional and formal laws. The MoJ and the Bar Association will

conduct public awareness campaigns to increase knowledge of laws and citizens' rights and responsibilities.

Outcome indicators (by end 2017): Surveys will show reduced corruption in the justice system and

increased public confidence. The case backlog will be significantly reduced and a much higher proportion of

cases on the docket will be fully tried within a year. Thus, the number of inmates in pretrial detention will be

greatly reduced. An electronic centralized resource will hold all court records and case management data.

Traditional leaders will appropriately handle and report on increased numbers of cases. All segments of the

population, both geographically and demographically, will have ready access to courts and judicial

personnel.

Priority interventions: Priorities for the justice and rule of law sector are designed to focus on the poorest and most vulnerable and the specific needs of children. Implementing the Law Reform Commission's report on informal traditional and formal statutory systems of justice will be critical to clearly defining the scope of the traditional system and reducing conflicts between the two systems. Other priorities include strengthening the jury duty system, based on the new Jury Law; increase access to legal aid-not limited to formal legal proceedings, but also advisory services to assist in obtaining benefits and services; and creating a framework to encourage the provision of legal assistance by civil society and legal professionals in civil cases, as well as support to victims of crime. There will be an increase in legal and justice services for vulnerable and marginalized members of society, especially women, children and youth; and for the rehabilitative and preventive aspects of justice, with emphasis on community responsibility. A national action plan for the fight against trafficking in persons in Liberia will be developed and implemented. Investments will be made to improve conditions in detention and prison facilities, in compliance with international human rights standards, and complete the construction of a new central prison in Montserrado (started in the 150 Days). The probation program will be extended beyond the two original counties, to reduce prison overcrowding; and more efficient systems for case management and gathering and preserving evidence will be introduced.

8.4 JUDICIAL REFORM

The Liberian Judiciary has made significant progress in reforming judicial institutions over the past few years. To

Box 8.2: Costed

Priority Justice and the Rule of Sector Interventions

• Strengthen public defender system

• Provide care services for survivors of SGBV

• Strengthen the JIC and LACC to better investigate complaints of corrupt practices and clarify roles of LACC and MoJ in prosecutions

• Develop public understanding of the harmonized justice system, its importance and relation to customary laws

• Assign social workers and psychosocial support staff to police/correction facilities address staffing and skills gaps within judicial institutions, the James A.A. Pierre Judicial Institute was established and has developed a number of training programs for judicial and support staff, including a one- year training course for professional magistrates. In order to address the acute judicial infrastructure problem the judiciary has identified and prioritized outstanding infrastructural and operational tools required for the effective functioning of all legal and judicial institutions, and a number of new facilities have been constructed.

However, a shortage of qualified judges, magistrates and court support staff still exists, and working conditions for most judicial and support staffs are inadequate. The court system is skewed relative to the present geographic and demographic distributions in Liberia, which impedes access to justice. Statutes concerning the location of courts hinder the Judiciary from improving the location of courts and their staffing. Many of the magisterial courts on the roster of the Judiciary are not functioning or have very low case flows, while others are overburdened.

Goal: Protect the rights and dignity of all through a strengthened, credible and independent Judiciary that delivers transparent justice.

Constraints: The Liberian Judiciary suffers from low public confidence due to its perceived lack of

independence from other branches of government and from political influences. Credibility and

effectiveness are further undermined by limited human capacity, inadequacy of accounting and auditing,

and the current legal framework, which does not assure access to justice for all, particularly the most

vulnerable.

Strategic objectives: Faced with these significant challenges, the medium-term objectives of judicial

reform are to build the credibility of an independent Judiciary; increase access to justice through a revised

legal framework and sound and responsive financial management with the Judiciary Financial Autonomy

Act; and enhance the effectiveness of the Judiciary through investment in strategic and sustained human

resource development. As the branch of government with a constitutional mandate to interpret the laws of

Liberia, the Judiciary's perceived and real neutrality and independence is an absolute priority.

Agents and process for change: The Judiciary will take the lead in directing its own reform, in keeping

with the need to enhance its independence. It will do so in consultation with the Law Reform Commission

and the Executive and Legislature, and with support from the Judicial Institute and the Louis Arthur

Grimes School of Law. The Ministry of Finance (MoF) will provide technical assistance to implement the

new financial management system.

Outcome indicators (by end 2017): Access to justice will be increased, with circuit, magisterial and specialized courts established in each county. There will be an increased range and number of cases handled by magisterial courts and by specialized courts; a 90 percent increase in revenue remitted to the court system; increased availability of adequately staffed and effectively functioning courts for all geographic and demographic segments of the population.

Priority interventions: The capacity of the Judiciary's administration and staff will be strengthened by providing systematic and sustained training, capacity building and reorientation of judicial and support personnel through the James A.A. Pierre Judicial Institute. Staffing and location of courts will be rationalized based on the geographic, demographic and justice needs of the country. Working conditions and resources for Judiciary staff will be improved, so that talented individuals are drawn to Judiciary employment and provide a high level of service. This will be achieved through regularized remuneration systems for judicial and support staff; provision of attractive pay packages to attract and retain qualified staff; clear and transparent recruitment procedures and staff performance management. The number of cases that can be efficiently and effectively handled by the courts will be increased by expanding the jurisdiction of magistrates' court. The Jury Law will be reformed, a legal framework established for institutionalizing specialized courts where needed; and the number of circuit court judges and public defenders increased to ensure that there are two or more public defenders per county. These measures will lead to a reduction in the caseload of circuit courts and increase access to justice. A Judiciary accountability and oversight system will be established to reduce corruption risk, drive efficiency improvements, and build public confidence. Judicial organization will be revised to minimize opportunities for corruption. An effective financial management system will be developed to support decentralization and revenue generation-updating obsolete fee schedules and allowing judicial and support staff to receive their salaries outside of Monrovia. A Financial Management Plan will outline the collection of revenue as well as establish rules, guidelines and mechanisms for the management of finances-making it transparent, credible and in accord with internationally accepted accounting and reporting standards.

8.5 CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT NEEDS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR SECURITY SECTOR

The locally created results framework that underpins the peace, security and rule of law pillar presents common capacity constraints and challenges at the institutional level involving both state and non-state actors. These challenges include:

• Incompatibility of social norms and values involving divisive historical identities, and inconsistencies generated through a dual justice system;

• Lack of demand for accountability, including lack of parliamentary and civilian oversight over security issues;

• Unclear stakeholder rights and responsibilities, as reflected in a lack of consensus by diverse actors on the approach to sustainable peace and reconciliation;

• Operational inefficiencies at various levels, involving lack of coordination of conflict prevention and resolution efforts, overlapping service provision, inefficient practices in the service sector inhibiting its functioning, and limited human capacities of judicial services.

of Sector Interventions

• Expand and modernize training facilities

• Provide regular in-service and pre-service training to magistrates, judges and staff

Accordingly, the AfT design process has identified priority "transformational" types of interventions aimed at empowering local agents of change (involving CSOs, legislature, government sector) to achieve enhanced peace and security intermediate outcomes, including:

• Developing new know-how and improved consensus for enhanced peace and reconciliation (e.g., updating Liberia history curriculum and content of Liberian civic education, promoting public understanding and consensus on a harmonized justice system);

• Raising awareness and knowledge of legal information, strengthening coalitions and networks to better monitor security agencies and justice activities (e.g., installing civil oversight boards for all security agencies; bringing CSOs together to provide more effective oversight; organizing community forums on security; providing civil education);

• Enhancing know-how, institutional teamwork, and collaboration on peace and security activities, which could enhance operational efficiencies of the security sector (e.g., mapping of existing security activities; providing conflict monitoring; supporting community peace communities; enhanced investigative skills on security matters)

CHAPTER 9. PILLAR II-ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION

Liberia's economy-after experiencing gradual decline from the mid-1970s to the late 1980s-suffered one of the steepest collapses in recorded modern economic history, with GDP per capita falling by about 90 percent from 1987 to 1994 (World Bank, 2011b, p. 5)27. This was largely due to the civil war, which disrupted all normal economic activities. However, it is also important to recognize that the structural composition of the economy- heavily dependent on extractive industries (iron ore, forestry, etc.) owned by foreign nationals-compounded the effects of the civil war, as these foreign nationals often closed their operations and fled the country.

The lack of strong indigenous ownership of the economy, coupled with the massive destruction of infrastructure (power plants, transmission lines, roads, bridges), made the economic collapse more devastating for ordinary Liberians, as basic commodities became very expensive and the income base disappeared. High prices combined with no household income placed a lot of pressure on the Government to move quickly to revitalize the economy and provide hope to Liberians-and this was the primary preoccupation of the Government during the PRS.

Revitalizing the economy meant resuscitating traditional engines (i.e., attracting massive FDI in the mining, forestry, and agriculture sectors). But while the Government was able to effectively revitalize the

27 World Bank, World Development Indicators economy, it was not sufficient to improve the income base of ordinary Liberians and thus improve their livelihoods. Now the challenge is to transform the economy in both substance and form so that it benefits locals while also shielding itself from exogenous and endogenous shocks.

Goal: To transform the economy so that it meets the demands of Liberians through development of the domestic private sector-using resources leveraged from FDI in mining and plantations; providing employment for a youthful population; investing in infrastructure for economic growth; addressing fiscal and monetary issues for macroeconomic stability; and improving agriculture and forestry to expand the economy for rural participation and food security.

This AfT includes both the productive sectors that will grow the economy, and Government policy and infrastructure programs to support these sectors. Essential to this economic transformation (which was limited during PRS), is the growth of employment and output in agriculture, small-scale mining and forestry, agro-processing and other industries that produce import-substitutes and could potentially reach export levels. Development of these sectors, along with commercial and service enterprises, is necessary for making GDP growth translate into wealth creation that reduces poverty through employment and private enterprise.

Ideally, households and individuals will have more opportunity to work or engage in their own enterprises, leading to improved income and the opportunity to purchase desired consumption. To support provision of public services and infrastructure, the private economy and concessions will generate tax and royalty revenue for the public sector. In some cases the concession agreements will go further, stipulating that PPPs provide infrastructure and workers' training. The sectors with important concessions include large-scale mineral extraction and export (iron, possibly petroleum); plantation agriculture (rubber, palm oil); and large-scale forestry. As discussed in the latter part of this chapter, these sectors also include many smallholders, some of whom need government assistance with capacity building, marketing and infrastructure.

A major challenge for Liberia is to avoid growing its GDP primarily through mineral exports from enclaves that do not offer improvement for everyday livelihoods. The temptation that entraps many resource-rich countries is to spend most of the concessions revenue on marginally productive government-generated employment and consumption subsidies.28 Past experience in Liberia and elsewhere has shown that this type of dual economy does not support equitable or sustainable development. Liberia plans to avoid this trap by stimulating private sector growth in more labor-intensive areas. The Government cannot efficiently engage in these productive activities directly. Rather, it is creating an enabling environment by providing an appropriate legal and regulatory framework, and by using the tax and royalty revenues from concessions to finance electric power and transport infrastructure, education and training, and other inputs that the private sector needs. While the priority interventions listed below focus on government policies and programs, it is important to recognize that economic transformation and sustainable growth rely on the actions of private entrepreneurs, farmers, and concessionaires who respond to the interventions.

28 This problem is often called Dutch Disease, because it arose during the boom with North Sea natural gas in

Holland during the 1970s. Recent research has shown that this problem is common but avoidable with prudent policies.

Table 9.1 shows such a results chain for Pillar II. The middle column shows the essential core-growth in the private productive sectors; the column on the left shows the Government's programs that enable and encourage this private sector development with the private sector, not government, acting as the main source of employment (important for economic growth and political sustainability). As quality employment becomes more available, Liberians will begin to see the private sector as the source of their livelihoods, which will build political support for business-friendly policies. The column on the right shows the intended results of Pillar II-increases in quality employment and household incomes. Government revenues from the mineral sector and, increasingly, the private sector are essential to the feedback loop to make this transformation self-sustaining.

Table 9.1: Economic Transformation Pillar Results Chain

Government Programs and PPPs Private Sector Results Overall Pillar Results

• Appropriate regulatory and legal environment

• International trade opportunities

• Macroeconomic stability and financial sector services

• Economic infrastructure

• Education and training



• Investment and growth of output and exports:

- SMEs - Industry - Agriculture - Forestry

- Mining



• Growth of quality employment, business opportunities, and household income

• Government revenue funding for infrastructure and HD programs.

The main challenge of generating income outside of the concessions and the public sector is closely related to the cross-cutting issues elaborated in Chapter 12. The link to Labor and Employment is critical because increased earnings will allow Liberia's growth to lead to poverty reduction and the creation of a middle-income society. Economic transformation also connects with six other cross-cutting issues: Gender Equality, Human Rights, Youth Empowerment, Prevention of Child Abuse, and Fair Treatment of Those with HIV/AIDS or with Disabilities. The environment, mining and forestry sectors are of particular important for economic transformation.

Table 9.2 summarizes the goals within each sector. Table 9.3 at the end of this chapter summarizes the strategic objectives and specific outcomes for achieving these goals by 2017.

Table 9.2: Sector Goals for Economic Transformation

15. Promote a robust, competitive and modernized agriculture sector supportive of sustainable economic growth and development.

E. FORESTRY:

16. Integrate community, conservation and commercial aspects of forestry to sustainably contribute to reducing poverty, improving livelihoods and the quality of rural life, and increasing the ecological services provided by forests.

F. MINERAL DEVELOPMENT and MANAGEMENT:

17. Promote a sustainable, transparent, and well-managed exploitation of Liberia's mineral resources and an equitable distribution of the benefits among citizens

9.1. PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT

Growth of private sector businesses, outside the primary sectors, will be critical for the type of wealth creation that leads to poverty reduction and economic growth over the next five years. Achieving middle-income status will depend on type of wealth creation, no matter how much GDP is generated from large mines and plantations. This section discusses the prospects for and needs of MSMEs and industrial aspects of the private sector, and how the Government will improve the private sector environment by improving access to financing, the regulatory environment, property rights, contract enforcement, and international trade opportunities. The overarching goal of the private sector is to promote and sustain private sector development through enhanced economic competitiveness and diversification, increased value addition, and an improved administrative and policy environment.

MSME Growth and Financing

Commerce and small businesses-MSMEs- are at the heart of our country's private sector. Local traders, welding shops, and market women generate economic opportunities for themselves, their families, and their local communities and make a significant, but often unaccounted for, contribution to the Liberian economy. MSMEs will most likely be the main entry point to the labor market for the youth and disadvantaged, especially those who lack formal education. MSMEs grew in employment and output between 2008 and 2011, but not as rapidly as hoped. Because of the establishment of a One-Stop-Shop for business registry and other measures, MSME registrations in the formal sector have accelerated, especially for Liberian-owned businesses, although they remain a minority of businesses in the country. Government assistance seems to have helped some firms, but not all. In the 2011 Stakeholder Survey29, 49 percent of respondents answered "Yes" and 42 percent answered "No" when asked "Have government policies in the last three years enabled you or members of your community to set up and operate small business?" The number of microfinance lenders increased from three (3) in 2006 to eight (8) in 2010, including Access Bank Liberia Ltd.; the number of deposits and borrowers grew from 300 to 50,000 over the same period.

Goal: To ensure rapid growth of MSMEs that will lead to increased employment and wealth creation and reduced poverty.

29 "Lift Liberia" Poverty Reduction Strategy Final report - A results Focused Assessment (http://www.lr.undp.org/Documents/PDF/reduction_strategy.pdf)

Constraints: MSMEs often stay out of the formal sector because excessive regulations and a rigid fiscal regime far outweigh the perceived benefits of formality. But then these enterprises face more difficulty in getting credit and receive less protection of their property rights. Their workers are left unregulated and often face unhealthy conditions. Staying in the informal sector thus traps the enterprises in a low equilibrium of small-scale and low returns, creating a "hand-to-mouth" existence. Lack of credit as a constraint to expansion was cited by more than 70 percent of MSMEs. Further, banks are inexperienced in lending to MSMEs (typically not in the formal sector) and are reluctant to lend because legal claims for loan repayment are difficult to enforce. Without deposit mobilization schemes, banks have no history established with potential borrowers, and such borrowers have insufficient equity to absorb normal income fluctuations that may otherwise lead a solvent enterprise to loan default due to temporary illiquidity. MSME owners and managers typically lack knowledge of the technology and business practices that are needed to expand and create more jobs and wealth. They also lack access to markets and information.

Strategic objectives: The Government's policy for industry focuses on (a) improving options for industry to employ Liberian workers, including under-represented groups; (b) providing access to technology and infrastructure, and streamline regulations to increase competiveness of new and existing industrial enterprises; (c) improving access to sustainable financing for industry; and (d) increasing entrepreneurial capacity for industry.

Agents and process of change: The National Investment Commission (NIC) and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MoCI) will work together to establish the National Industrial Development and Financing Organization, which will report to the MoCI. The Legislature will pass the appropriate laws and MoCI will issue the accompanying regulations. The MoCI, NIC and National Industrial Development Financing Organization (NIDFO) will work with Liberian business associations, government organizations-the Legislature, MoF, Central Bank of Liberia (CBL), Ministry of Lands, Mines and Energy (MLME), and Land Commission, and international partners (IFC and the UNDP) to ensure that the planned measures are implemented and to monitor their results. The Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) will also support expansion of food processing industries.

Outcome indicators (by 2017): The country will see growth of industrial value-added products and increased employment of Liberian workers, including women, youth, and people with disabilities and HIV/AIDS. More registered industrial firms will be in operation, and they will have increased investment and equity accumulation.

Priority interventions: The Government will carry out the National Jobs Creation Plan, launched during the 150 Days, and build capacity of Liberian workers by collaborating with the private sector on demand-driven skills training and development. It will create incentives for businesses to provide employment and training to Liberian staff in technical areas. The Government will conduct regular dialogue with private-sector representatives concerning their labor needs and supply constraints, and ensure that graduates have the skills needed by the market. This reflects an important link with the education sector in the HD pillar and with the cross-cutting issue of labor and employment.

In alignment with the African Union Action Plan, the NIDFO will provide support services to nascent industries through a combination of business incubation, incentives, financing, training, and information/outreach programs. The Government will implement regulations to assure that the NDIFO and other industrial support arrangements are not captured by political or patronage interests and do not subsidize enterprises that are inefficient or persistently lose money. It will complete the regulatory framework for bank and non-bank leasing operations, and expedite information flows and institutional processes to enable investors to start leasing. The Central Bank will work with the Liberian Bankers' Association and others to fast-track full implementation of the Commercial Code and Commercial Court, reduce loan defaults to near zero, end informal payments to bank employees for faster service, introduce publicized "fast-lane" fees to expedite loan processing, and develop a training curriculum for MSMEs to help them prepare their projects for appraisal by banks.

The Government will also identify linkages between local industries and other priority sectors (such as agriculture); examine how Liberian industries can fit into local, regional, and global value chains; and provide corresponding services. The Government will develop and implement a Competition Law to prevent monopolistic and restrictive trade practices that could damage the overall economy; to ensure more competitive prices; and to help improve the quality of products. To mitigate the problems of land property rights and infrastructure provision while working on longer-term solutions, the Government will establish and expand areas for industrial production and processing, such as export processing zones, industrial estates, and special economic zones. It will track and measure the impact fiscal incentives have on industries and adapt them accordingly.

Regulatory Environment

Issues in the regulatory environment include both rules for entering the formal sector, and implementation of regulations for firms in the formal sector. During the first PRS, the Ministry of Commerce streamlined procedures for registering firms with measures such as the One-Stop-Shop and the Business Reform Committee (BRC). The number of registrations grew from around 5,000 in 2006-07 to more than 8,000 in 2010-11. Now the challenge is to increase the advantages of being registered in the formal sector. It appears that some regulations currently hinder, rather than businesses. This is reflected in the strong complaints about regulations in surveys.(PRS Assessment, 2011). The rights of workers will be protected by enforcement of the Decent Wage Bill. Product regulations currently do not ensure that Liberian products are adequately standardized and reliable for domestic and international markets. Consumers' rights are not adequately protected; thus the MoCI will, during the AfT period, build and strengthen the capacity of its Consumer Protection Unit.

Goal:  Reduce impediments to expansion of employment and production, especially of tradable goods, and assure worker safety and environment protection.

Constraints: Current regulations and their implementation are onerous, often with frequent inspections and opportunities for officials to request bribes. Yet, these regulations do not adequately assure the safety of products, certify their quality, or protect the safety of workers. It is also difficult for firms to officially close when conditions make it necessary to do so.

Strategic objectives: The Government will revise regulations-and especially their implementation and cost-to increase the benefits of being in the formal sector and make Liberian products more competitive internationally and with imports. It will ensure safe working conditions and fair treatment for all categories of workers; protect consumer health and rights; and harmonize regulations and inspection procedures across government agencies.

Agents and process of change: The MoCI will work with the BRC, NIC, and MoL to propose appropriate legal reforms and revise regulations to make it easier to establish industrial enterprises and facilitate the expansion of MSMEs into the formal industrial sector. The National Standards Laboratory (NSL) will also help industrial expansion from the demand side, both domestic and international, by ensuring that Liberian products meet good quality standards. MoCI will ensure compatibility among the inputs from MoL, BRC and other stakeholders, and will coordinate the monitoring of results.

Outcome indicators (by 2017): Doing Business and other international ratings of Liberia's business climate will improve. Other indicators include the growth of exports from non-concession sectors and of domestic production that competes with imports; improved satisfaction with Liberian products by domestic consumers; and improved environmental compliance and treatment of workers.

Priority interventions: To achieve the overall objective of increasing growth and employment, the Government will improve the regulatory environment for private enterprises, large and small. To reduce the time and money required to register informal enterprises and petty traders, key ministries and agencies will continue to streamline the administrative processes for incorporating and registering companies. When firms join the formal sector, the wider society also benefits through increased tax revenue and more compliance with regulations, including labor conditions, gender equality, food safety, and environmental protection. The BRC will continue to work to address ambiguities and overlaps in government regulations. Government ministries and agencies will streamline and coordinate inspections and licensing requirements. They will reduce the number of government agencies carrying out monthly inspections at all enterprises-from about 13 now to less than seven for large enterprises and two or less for MSMEs.

The National Standards Laboratory will be ISO certified and adopt international standards for key products. The capacity and skills of the NSL staff will be strengthened to enforce those standards. The MoL will review and revise the labor regulations and their implementation, so that employers can hire adult workers freely, without formal or informal restraint and so that previously disadvantaged groups get an equal chance for hiring. Laws and effective regulation to guard the rights of these groups-women, youth, those with HIV/AIDS and other disabilities, will be enforced.

The Government will work with business associations so that they can raise awareness of the value of formalizing and encourage their members to do so. Government, donors, and business associations will collaborate to identify and eliminate administrative procedures that unnecessarily increase the cost of production and trading.

Property Rights and Contract Enforcement

Both domestic and foreign firms face a high cost and risk of investment due to uncertainty of land claims, leasing arrangements, and other contracts. Liberian-owned enterprises that do not have international venues in which to enforce their claims are often at a greater disadvantage.

Goal: Ensure that real property rights, intellectual property rights, and other contractual rights are respected and enforced so that Liberian and foreign investment becomes more attractive and increases.

Constraints: Land tenure is unclear and insecure because of poor records and conflicts between formal and traditional concepts of land claims. Leases and other contracts have uncertain enforceability, due to the ambiguity of laws and problems with the courts, as discussed in Chapter11. Corruption in both public and private sector entities discourages investment by foreign and domestic enterprises.

Strategic objectives: Laws and the implementing institutions that enforce property rights, including intellectual property and commercial contractual rights, will be strengthened. Contract enforcement through courts and arbitration would further enhance the value of being in the formal sector. Making enforcement of contracts and property rights available to more MSMEs will encourage them to move into the formal sector.

Agents and process of change: The Land Commission will work with MoJ and MLME to identify the legal and regulatory changes needed to make property rights more clear and secure for all classes of investors-domestic MSMEs and tribal and community groups, as well as larger domestic and foreign enterprises. Given that the present property claims overlap at times, clarification will force some groups to accept losses, relative to what they thought they had, so the President and other political leaders will discuss these difficult decisions and arrange appropriate compensation in some cases. The Land Commission and MoJ will recommend changes; the President will decide what recommendations to follow and direct MoJ and MLME on implementation.

Outcome indicators by 2017: There will be increased public and private investment in business, infrastructure, and agriculture. An increased number of property rights and contracts cases will be resolved. Surveys will show that Liberians believe there are clearer definitions and better protection of communal and private land claims, including claims by women.

Priority interventions: The Government will establish and operate both a Commercial Code to govern transactions and a Commercial Court that can enforce commercial contracts. The Government will also upgrade the courts and institute a small claims court to settle such claims expeditiously. To increase the reliability and duration of lease options, for both domestic and foreign-owned enterprises, the Government will establish and implement a system for cost-effective dispute resolution for leases. It will also run an awareness campaign to improve public understanding of contractual rights and obligations and to change attitudes toward compliance.

Trade-Regional and International Integration

Liberia imports about three times as much as it exports, which has been possible largely due to aid inflows. A third of MSMEs in the country and essentially all large firms reported having sold to or bought from a foreign buyer/seller (National Export Strategy 2011, p. 2)30. This shows that Liberian firms have connections with international markets, but they still rarely use these connections for trade in an export direction. This is expected to change in the next five years as Liberia increases its exports from both concessions and agriculture and industry-and as aid flows taper off. Imports come both by sea, mainly through the Freeport of Monrovia, and by land at border crossings, particularly with Guinea. The Bureau of Customs and Excise at the Ministry of Finance has been implementing reforms and strengthening its programs, including automation of procedures at the three most active ports of entry, which has expedited trade and increased revenues to the Treasury.

Goal: Facilitate agriculture, MSMEs' exports, as well as the import of goods for investment and consumption.

Constraints: The inadequate capacity to produce products for trade; inadequate transport infrastructure to link potential producers with international trade via sea and the land border crossings; inadequate knowledge by MSMEs about international markets; cumbersome regulations that impede international trade; and unfinished agreements with regional and international trade partners. The first three constraints are addressed in other sections of this chapter.-

Strategic objectives: Promote Liberian products for international markets. Facilitate exports through special export processing zones; improved trade agreements; and training for entrepreneurs, including women. Make customs and border-control measures more efficient.

Outcome indicators (by 2017): Increased exports from agriculture, agro-industry and manufacturing. Reduced time to clear imports and exports through customs. Reduced time to get rebates of taxes and duties paid on inputs used for producing exports and reduce cross-border smuggling.

Priority interventions: The Government has developed a National Export Strategy (2011) "with the aim of reviving the export sector and creating sustainable employment for a vast proportion of the Liberian population." To encourage production for export and increase the availability of areas for industrial production and processing for international markets, the Government will establish a new special economic zone with infrastructure and utilities; it will also rezone the Gardnersville Industrial Park and Industrial Free Zone at the Monrovia Freeport area to its previous use as a SEZ. To improve the international environment for Liberia's exports and imports, MoCI will advance Liberia's trade negotiations with the EU, WTO and other trading partners. It will further the harmonization of tariffs with ECOWAS. These processes will be paced to allow time for Liberia to develop its own industrial potential. To make its products more attractive, MoCI will improve enforcement of product standards and quality control, and the Government will enact a new Customs Code. Increased enforcement and improved monitoring of local-content requirements will reduce smuggling. The Government will continue to streamline the process of trading across borders and dealing with trade officials-automating customs procedures at all the ports of entry-in order to increase the amount of legal trading and duty collected, while improving control against illicit trade.

9.2 MACROECONOMIC ISSUES

Liberia followed sound macroeconomic policy from 2008 to 2011. The Government will now maintain and build on this record while at the same time using fiscal and monetary policies to give more support to private-sector growth. Achieving that growth, discussed in the previous section, will be

Box 9.0: Costed

Priority Private Sector Development Interventions

• Establish a functional special economic zone (SEZ) with infrastructure and utilities, and companies

• Support a Private sector finance fund that provides fixed capital financing for Liberian businesses in high priority industries through a government loan guarantee scheme

• Encourage provision of low cost services, training, technology, financing and other products to industries e.g. business incubation, financing, training and information, technology transfer

• Further decentralize the business registry activities in other regions in Liberia.

• Reduce the time and money needed to register an informal enterprise and petty traders essential to avoid social and political discontent that could undermine the public's support for prudent macroeconomic management.

Goal: To maintain fiscal, monetary, trade and exchange rate policies that entrench macroeconomic stability and support efficient public expenditure management, expand inclusive private-sector growth and job creation.

Fiscal and Debt Management

During PRS, the Government pursued sound fiscal policy and debt management, achieving balanced budgets and negotiating major reductions of public debt, as documented in recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) reports31. With the debt reduction operations, public external debt declined from 191 percent of GDP in 2009 to under 12 percent in 2010; domestic debt is around 27 percent of GDP and projected to decline32. Total revenue has been 25-30 percent of GDP, with taxes on incomes and international trade each contributing a third (IMF 2011, pp. 17, 21)33. Introducing the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) improved internal knowledge and external transparency about spending and revenues. Nonetheless, the macro-stability remains vulnerable to shocks and fiscal institutions are not yet robust. Public investment has been low, varying between 3.5 and 6 percent of GDP.

Goal: Maintain sustainable fiscal balances and debt levels, while improving the transparency, accountability and efficiency of public expenditure and raising more public revenues.

Constraints: There is weak capacity for financial management and monitoring in spending ministries. Government revenues may be variable and uncertain due to world price fluctuations on concessions revenues and variability in international aid flows as development partners face their own budget uncertainties. Liberia's tax laws and revenue collection institutions require further strengthening.

Strategic objectives: Strengthen institutions for fiscal planning, accountability and transparency. Prepare fiscal arrangements to support de-concentration and phased decentralization of government. Strengthen revenue inflows and administration.

Agents and process of change: The MoF will continue working with international partners, particularly the IMF and World Bank, to ensure that the macroeconomic policy remains sound and is properly integrated with the domestic budgeting strategy and realistic projections of financial support from the numerous development partners. The Aid Management Unit in MoF, established in 2010, will continue to improve the projections and reporting of donor financing. The Department of Revenue in MoF will strengthen tax collection capacity, increase revenue, and consult with business associations to assure that this is done without excessive compliance costs for private enterprises. The MIA and MoF will work with the emerging sub-national government institutions to ensure that their activities are well integrated with the overall budget framework and reporting. The MoF will bring the MPEA and LDA fully into its organization, thus unifying the domestic planning and external dialogue on budgets and donor support.

31 International Monetary Fund, 2011, Liberia: Sixth Review Under the Three-Year Arrangement Under the

Extended Credit Facility, Request for Extension of the Arrangement, and Augmentation of Access, Report No. 11/174, Washington, DC.

32 Ibid 68 33 Ibid 68

Outcome indicators (by 2017): Indicators include increased investment as a share of public spending; a sustainable structure and level of public debt-especially floating debt and arrears, which are often early warnings of fiscal problems; and collection of revenue, will grow to match expenditures. Other indicators will be reduced time between the end of the fiscal year and the publication of audited accounts and decreased differences between the initial approved budget and the final audited budget statement.

Priority interventions: To sustain the pace of progress, the Government will improve its financial programming with the introduction of a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework, described in the economic governance section of Chapter 11. To ensure wise use of Liberia's revenue from concessions- essentially sale of national assets-the Government will increase its share of spending for public investment, thus creating new productive national assets. A Budget Framework Paper will outline the projected evolution of the government budget constraints given growth projections, revenue scenarios and debt servicing requirements. Within these constraints, the MoF and MoPEA will use the MTEF exercise to work with line ministries and agencies to make rolling three-year plans for investment and recurrent spending that are fiscally sustainable and in line with the Agenda for Transformation priorities. The President and MACs will establish strict adherence with the Budget Framework Paper.

In order to avoid excess dependence on concessions revenues and external assistance, the Government will strengthen its systems for collecting revenue from the domestic economy. It will simplify tax administration and revise tax incentives to reflect the concerns and constraints of businesses. It will also increase the portion of taxes processed electronically.

As the Government moves forward with its de-concentration and decentralization plans, discussed in Chapter 11, it will establish treasury units in all 15 counties, both for disbursement of expenditure and for receipt of tax payments. These will be consistent with ongoing programs to pay salaries through bank accounts and have more tax payments made electronically.

Monetary

Liberia has an important advantage of a good-although short-record of conservative monetary policy. During the first PRS, it achieved low inflation and a stable exchange rate, and the dual currency system has worked well for Liberia. Extensive and official use of the US dollar has provided an effective nominal anchor to the low-inflation policy of the US Federal Reserve, while the Central Bank of Liberia (CBL) has managed the supply of Liberian dollars so that the exchange rate in the auction market has been stable though fixed, and inflation averaged less than 5 percent during the PRS period (2008-2011). Liberia's banking system has improved since 2005, with the number of commercial banks rising to eight; and the minimum capital requirement was increased from US$2 million in 2006 to US$10 million in December 2010. Nonetheless, the banks remain weak and reluctant to lend to the private sector; returns on assets and on equity are barely above zero. Non-performing loans (NPL) have declined from three-fifths of bank portfolios in the early 2000s to less than one-quarter, all of which are fully provisioned as of August 2011, but the NPL ratio is still higher than regional comparators (IMF 2011, pp. 8-9).

Goal: To avoid high inflation and exchange rate volatility and develop a growth enhancing financial system.

Constraints: There is fragile confidence in the money and banking systems. Banks' balance sheets are still weak, which discourages them from making the longer-term loans that businesses need to expand, especially small and new businesses.

Strategic objectives: Continue conservative aggregate monetary policy. Strengthen bank supervision. Encourage gradual expansion of bank lending and other services to MSMEs and underserved communities.

Agents and process of change: The CBL will build its institutional capacity to manage the markets for foreign exchange and government bonds as well as regulate commercial banks. The CBL will work with MoF, MoCI, commercial banks and business associations to ensure that banks are properly regulated and that their operations are consistent with sound aggregate monetary policy. The IMF and World Bank will provide technical assistance as appropriate.

Outcome indicators (by 2017): Stable aggregate price indices and exchange rate. Commercial banks will enjoy adequate capital to loan ratios and reduction in the stock of NPLs. MSMEs will use banks more for deposits and be granted more loans. An increased share of households and MSMEs will use banking and other financial services.

Priority interventions: The CBL will continue to maintain adequate foreign exchange reserves and keep the exchange rate stable. The CBL will strive to implement a risk-based framework for financial supervision. The MoF and Central Bank will introduce the framework for a treasury-bill market. The CBL will continue a credit line for commercial banks' on-lending to MSMEs and will implement the proposals for modest credit lines to non-governmental microfinance institutions and to the Afri-Land Bank for smallholder tree crops with them bearing the credit risk.

9.3 INFRASTRUCTURE

Most of Liberia's infrastructure was destroyed or simply deteriorated beyond use during the years of conflict. While rebuilding was a priority during PRS and the transition period, the majority of work remains to be done.

With the emerging economic activities in mining, logging and agriculture, concessions will account for a significant portion of the country's infrastructure needs going forward. They will need around 30 percent of feeder roads, 80 percent of power, and over 90 percent of port

Box 9.1: A Costed

Priority Macroeconomic Issues Sector Intervention

• Increase financing available to microfinance institutions.

services and railways. The Government will make sure that the concession agreements take due consideration of its fiscal and infrastructure needs, as well as the needs of the private sector and small-scale agriculture and forestry.

At the Economic Forum in September 2011, it was agreed to (a) explore channels for multi-stakeholder dialogue on infrastructure with the view of identifying win-win PPPs; (b) introduce a coordination mechanism among concessionaires and the Government to avoid sub-optimal investment decisions for rail and energy; (c) prioritize the resolution of road and port bottlenecks affecting small concessioners; (d) pursue PPPs to implement this strategy; and (e) collaborate on regional infrastructure projects such as the West Africa Power Project and Trans-West African Coastal Highway.

Power and Energy

Inadequate electricity remains a crippling constraint for MSMEs and industrial development. Essentially, the entire infrastructure for generation and distribution of electricity was destroyed during the war. With costs of power currently over US$0.50 per KWH, most manufacturing and processing projects are economically infeasible. Investments in power have projected economic rates of return of 15 to 30 percent per annum. During the first PRS, the power sector made little progress beginning from a very low starting point. There is still a long way to go to supply electricity to most of the economy, which is essential to reach the goal of middle-income status.

Goal: Increase access to renewable energy services and affordable power for community and economic transformation.

Constraints: The high capital cost of investment; lack of knowledge about alternatives; and poor coordination between government agencies, international donors and international investors.

Strategic Objectives: Supply affordable power from the grid to MSMEs, industries and households in urban areas, while supporting alternative modes of generation that can extend electricity to off-grid areas using small-scale thermal-, solar- and hydro-technologies. This will also entail consolidating the decision making process in government, improving donor coordination, utilizing PPPs, and securing agreement from mining companies to invest in (or otherwise support) power generation and transmission from which other users can also buy power. The energy sector will increase its environmental sustainability, including reduced use of charcoal and wood for fuel.

Agents and process of change: The Energy Technical Committee, Liberian Electrical Corporation (LEC) and the Rural Renewable Electrification Agency (RREA) will work with development partners to plan, finance and carry out the reconstruction and rehabilitation of key power infrastructure for centralized generation and decentralized rural power supply. Large mining enterprises will also play a role as major customers, sources of finance and perhaps as implementers of power supply for themselves and communities near the mines. Since much of the financing for energy investment will come from development partners and international mineral companies, decisions on design and implementation will be made jointly, through an iterative process that started in the first PRS and the 150 Days. Companies, now exploring for off-shore oil and natural gas, will also play a meaningful role if they find deposits. Even if these do not come online until after 2017, they could have a major impact sooner on energy planning and investment.

Outcome indicators (by 2017): More households and enterprises will have access to electric power at reduced costs and increased reliability. There will also be increased safe access to petroleum fuel outside Monrovia and more access to fuel that doesn't contribute to deforestation.

Priority interventions: Power sector investments planned under the AfT, include rehabilitation of the Mount Coffee Hydro-electric plant; addition of back-up heavy fuel oil generation capacity for the dry season; completion of the main transmission backbones and distribution facilities; and connection with the West African Power Pool. The estimated cost of these investments totals more than US$500 million from PPPs and international partners. The Government will also arrange the installation of solar lights in remote villages.

As the main consumers of power in Liberia, mining companies will examine, together with the government, the possibilities of building hydro- and heavy-fuel thermal generating plants. Because most of these facilities' output will be used by mining operations-as the power provisions of the concession agreements are finalized-they will be encouraged to build extra capacity and provide electricity to local enterprises and communities and eventually to the national grid at cost-recovery prices.

Since most communities will remain off the grid in the immediate future, the Government will support them in developing alternative options with small-scale thermal- hydro- and solar-energy. Currently, experiments with agriculture biomass for small diesel generators are being conducted; as success emerges from such pilots, the government will support their replication.

Box 9.2 below lists some costed priority interventions in the Energy Sector.

Transport Services

Offering international connections beyond the region-made considerable progress during the first PRS, mostly due to PPPs. Public transport remains minimal, especially beyond the Monrovia areas. The Ministry of Transport (MoT) and MPW, along with international partners, have prepared a comprehensive Transport Master Plan for the next five years and beyond, which also addresses roads and bridges.

Goal: Ensure that Liberians nationwide have increased safe, reliable, accessible, affordable and efficient transport services.

Box 9.2: Costed

Priority Energy Sector Interventions

• Distribution of electrical power to communities and connection of customers

• Reconstruction of Monrovia - RIA - Firestone 115 kV power transmission line

• Reconstruction of Monrovia - Kakata - Gbarnga 115 kV power transmission line

• Reconstruction of Monrovia - Tubmanburg 115 kV power transmission line

• Reconstruction of 64 MW Mount Coffee Hydropower Facility + Planning of SPRA

Hydropower Scheme

• Construction of 15 MW Heavy Fuel Oil plant

Constraints: Institutional limitations are the primary constraint to overall transport improvements. The MPW and MoT lack adequate technical and management capacity to deal with operations and management and private-sector contractors. Coordination between MPW, MoT and with other stakeholders in the sector remains a challenge.

Strategic objectives: Improve transport sector policy, assignment of functions, and planning-including coordination among government agencies and with neighboring countries. Improve the efficiency, transparency, environmental sustainability and safety of transport services nationwide, including alternate modes (e.g., rail and water). Provide hydrological and meteorological services to reduce disruptions of transportation services. Continue to improve management and facilities at sea and airports.

Agents and process of change: MoT has the lead for this sector. For seaports and airports, the main commercial users-mineral export and shipping companies and airlines- will continue to work in PPPs with the government port authorities; their needs will be to help guide investment decisions. Highway and urban transport operators will coordinate with MoT and NTA to improve services.

Outcome indicators (by 2017): More efficient and affordable rural and urban transport services in a range of modalities; increased public availability and accuracy of information on transport, hydrological and meteorological issues; and increased traffic volume and reduced turnaround time at sea and air ports.

Priority interventions: The National Transit Authority (NTA) launched an initiative in the 150 days to expand its national bus network, including the building of a new bus terminal and purchasing additional buses for its fleet. For seaports and airports, main users have better access to financing than the government and can internalize costs or charge user fees, thus the MoT will continue to work through PPPs to upgrade and expand facilities. To develop Liberia's potential as a regional trade hub, the Government will implement the Airport Master Plan; complete the dredging of Greenville ports; and extend the marginal wharf at the Freeport of Monrovia.

Box 9.3 below lists some costed priority interventions in the Transport Sector.

Roads and Bridges

Roads and bridges are Liberia's domestic arteries for delivery of public services and nearly all economic activity-except ore exports. Reconstruction and rehabilitation-more than US$500 million of investment during the first PRS including donor funding-has restored minimum usability to most of the

Box 9.3: Costed

Priority Transportation Sector Interventions

• Investment in the Transportation Master-plan

• Investment in seaports network. But transport costs remain high, averaging US$.20 per ton kilometer, due to poor road conditions and at times unusable bridges. About 95 percent of the road mileage rehabilitated or completed in the first PRS was for laterite roads, and not paved roads, which entail high annual maintenance costs. The MPW and MoT along with international partners have prepared a Transport Master Plan for the next five years and beyond. This plan contains full estimates of road construction and maintenance costs.

Goal: Improve year round accessibility and connectivity of roads and bridges.

Constraints: The cost of constructing or rehabilitating asphalt-paved roads is about 16 times higher than laterite (dirt) roads, but the latter deteriorate quickly and have annual maintenance costs of over one-third the initial investment. In parts of the country with low population density and economic activity, the cost per passenger-kilometer or per freight ton-kilometer of usage is extremely high. These low-density, high-cost road areas are also where poverty rates are highest; accessibility for counties in the southeast is particularly inadequate. The MPW and MoT lack adequate technical and contracting capacity as well as institutional capacity arrangements when dealing with operations and management of private sector contractors.

Strategic objectives: Improve road connections between all regions of Liberia, especially for southeast counties; open more secondary and feeder roads; and keep roads usable year round. Enhance operational efficiency through improved planning and procurement, including by strengthening the private road construction and maintenance sector, collaboration with concessionaires, and use of labor-intensive technologies that help reduce unemployment. Ensure participation from transport stakeholders and communities in road construction planning and monitoring to enhance accountability. The sector strategy will encourage a competitive private road construction and maintenance sector to reduce cost, and coordinate rural road development with agricultural development plans so that increased production can get to markets. The sector strategy will also explore alternative technology for rural road development, such as concrete block construction.

Agents and process of change: MPW will continue to lead on the roads and bridges. It has developed a medium-term investment and maintenance plan for roads and bridges, working with international development partners. The latter will probably fund much of the investment and some of the maintenance, at least in the early years, while the government budget will cover an increasing share of maintenance costs.

Outcome indicators (by 2017): There will be more roads in good condition throughout the year; reduced travel time and cost between regions and in urban areas; better access of rural areas to main highway corridors, and reduced traffic accidents per passenger mile. Procurement of road construction and maintenance will be more cost effective, and will use increased labor intensity of roadwork where appropriate. Surveys will indicate an increased sense of community ownership and satisfaction with road services.

Priority interventions: For roads and bridges, MPW will follow the Transport Master Plan to construct and rehabilitate segments of the nationwide network over the next five years and implement a strong maintenance plan. Primary roads will use a mix of laterite and paved construction; the more expensive paved roads will depend on the availability of funding, including those from donors. Secondary roads and feeder roads will use laterite construction, with trial use of concrete block paving. Employment intensive techniques are already in use in some areas in order to create jobs along with the road rehabilitation and maintenance; this will continue. MPW will coordinate with agencies for water, sewerage, electricity, and internet in order to ensure that new roads are not torn up by installation of utilities infrastructure. MoT will strengthen the institutional framework and capacity to promote road safety.

Box 9.4 below presents the major priority intervention in the Roads and Bridges Sector.

Public Housing and Buildings

The destruction and depreciation of infrastructure during the war, combined with recent population growth, means that the stock of low-income housing is inadequate to meet demand.

Goal: Expand access to affordable housing for low income households in all counties.

Constraints: Government agencies currently lack adequate capacity to carry out urban construction and related infrastructure work. Unclear legal claims to land tenure make investment outcomes uncertain, as discussed above.

Strategic objectives: Expand access to affordable housing, including for low-income groups and women. Improve housing policy, clarifying public- and private-sector roles and assuring fiscal affordability and community participation. Reduce government's costly use of rental buildings by restoring and upgrading public buildings. Encourage employment-intensive techniques where appropriate for construction and site preparation.

Agents and process of change: The National Housing Authority (NHA) will sensitize the population, business leaders and legislators on the importance of affordable housing. The NHA, local authorities, Shelter Afrique, the Central Bank and private-sector partners will work together to increase the availability of housing finance in ways that involve the private sector and do not increase fiscal and financial risk to the public sector. The Land Commission and local authorities will make appropriate zoning arrangements. The MPW, MoJ and local authorities will work together to implement the new zoning laws. The nature of involvement by local authorities will evolve as Liberia's decentralization program is implemented. The General Services Agency and MPW will coordinate on issues of public buildings.

Box 9.4: A Costed

Priority Roads and Bridges Sector Intervention

• Rehabilitate primary paved roads

Outcome indicators (by 2017): Increased number of low-income housing units and communities built in each county, with more pro-poor allocation of public housing. Increased numbers of public buildings restored and upgraded, and reduced outlays for renting buildings.

Priority interventions: To continue programs started during the 150 Days, the NHA will negotiate and acquire substantial land acreage in each county and in the Monrovia area and then construct affordable housing units. The Commercial Court will implement the Mortgage Chapter of the new Commercial Code. Shelter Afrique will sign on-lending agreements with local banks for credit lines, and major employers will channel monthly payrolls of mortgagees through employee bank accounts. The Government will rehabilitate and maintain at least 25 public buildings.

Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and Post

During the first PRS, the Government established key organizations to manage and operate the ICT and Post sector: the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications (MPT) was made to handle only policy and policy-related matters; the Liberia Telecommunications Authority (LTA) was given an independent regulatory mandate; and the Liberia Telecommunications Corporation (LIBTELCO) remained the national operator. In the meantime, lacking a clear national vision for the expansion of ICT/telecommunications, licenses were granted in the absence of sound regulation, resulting in market dominance by a few mobile phone operators and Internet service providers (ISPs). Nonetheless, preliminary results from the Core Welfare Indicator Questionnaire survey (CWIQ, 2010) suggests that access to cell phones is high, with over 50 percent of Liberian households owning one in 2010 (80 percent in the Monrovia area), and the prices are reasonable by international standards The absence of broadband access compels internet service providers (ISPs) to provide limited and poor quality services at high cost via satellite link. The submarine fiber-optic cable around West Africa has reached Liberia, making for a huge potential improvement in service, but it has not yet been linked with installations onshore.

Goal: To facilitate universal access, transparency, reliable and low cost postal, telecom and ICT services nationwide.

Constraints: Until 2012, the lack of broadband electronic linkage was a major constraint. Performance of the sector has also been constrained by limited financial and human resources in key agencies, inadequate telecommunications and postal infrastructure, and low levels of ICT penetration and literacy. The rapid evolution of alternatives to the traditional postal system and the potential cost of these alternatives have made prioritization decisions essential.

Strategic objectives: Upgrade domestic and international internet connectivity through efficient utilization of the international fiber optic link. Regulate internet and cell phone industries so that the private companies compete and provide efficient, secure and affordable service throughout the country. Develop the Liberian Postal System as a semi-autonomous corporation with a realistic mandate and a sound financial basis.

Agents and process of change: The MPT will lead the prioritization process, especially concerning postal services. The Liberia Telecommunications Authority, Liberia Telecommunications Corporation, and private companies in the sector will provide inputs and implement many of the details for the telecom and internet development. This will also involve post offices, since they will offer internet services especially for the poor and those living in remote areas. The Government, through LTA, will provide the regulatory framework for private-sector provision of cell phone and internet services. MPW and the General Services Agency (GSA) will participate in construction, equipping and staffing the post offices once political decisions have been made concerning the scope, mandate and financing for that service. Once the legislature and MoF decide on the medium-term resource envelope for traditional postal services, MPT will work with MPW and GSA to carry out the corresponding construction, equipping and staffing.

Outcome indicators (by 2017): there will be improved coverage and quality of internet and phone services, and the start of mail delivery, with fiscal sustainability and surveys indicating customers' satisfaction.

Priority interventions: To utilize the fiber optic cable, the Government will support deployment of national fiber infrastructure, linking the country to international high-speed broadband access. The Government will implement regulations, pricing and complementary infrastructure to make services accessible and available to wide circles of society. The MPT will coordinate with MPW to ensure the installation of underground fiber optic cable does not reverse the benefits of road construction and rehabilitation. The MPT will implement the plan, produced during the 150 Days, to convert the Liberia Telecommunications Corporation (LIBTELCO) into a PPP.

The Government will develop a National Postal Policy and implementation plan that recognizes the nation's needs, the latest developments in communication technology, and the overall budget constraints and priorities. The plan will include development of the necessary address and information systems and the needs for infrastructure, equipment and personnel.

9.4 AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SECURITY

As the largest source of employment and a source of food for its people, agriculture is central to Liberia's vision of economic transformation and wealth creation that leads to poverty reduction. The sector grew around 6 percent annually in 2008-09 but less than 4 percent annually in 2010-11, not as rapidly as expected or as in the initial post-2003 years. Despite the abundance of land and water, making multiple crops per year feasible and favorable to export, less than 5 percent of the land is under permanent cultivation, and less than 1 percent is irrigated. Large plantations with concessions produce most of the rubber and palm oil, but they also offer opportunities for small-holders to sell their output to the larger concerns. Firestone is a prime example, with large plantations, and also buying smoked rubber from individual farmers with some trees of their own. The small operations generally have lower efficiency and quality of tree care. Fisheries and animal husbandry are lagging and did not grow much during the first PRS (CWIQ, 2010). Less than half of the population today is food secured (Stakeholder Survey, 2011). To inform the future growth and development of the agriculture sector, the Government adopted the Cooperative Development Act2010 and an accompanying Liberia Cooperative Development Regulations of 2010. These documents have provided the enabling institutional and legal environment for the development of autonomous, viable and demand driven cooperative organizations.

Goal: To promote a robust, competitive and modernized agriculture sector supportive of sustainable economic growth and development.

Constraints: Small-holder farmers have low productivity due to inadequate inputs of fertilizer, irrigation, quality seed and breeding stock; they also lack adequate credit, machinery and infrastructure for transport, storage and marketing. This is related to the general absence of a food processing industry to prepare their products for wider domestic and eventually international markets. Small-scale farmers and fishers typically lack knowledge of market conditions, technology and best practices. Uncertainty of land tenure also discourages investment, adoption of improved techniques and economies of scale.

Strategic objectives: Increase agricultural productivity, value-added and environmental sustainability, especially for smallholders, including women and youth. Increase integration of small-holder agriculture with domestic and international markets. Increase fishery production in a sustainable manner. Increase access to machinery, fertilizer, storage, credit, training, technical assistance, market information, improved technologies, and related services, including farmer groups and nuclear farms. Increase access to land and security of tenure. Improve nutrition for all Liberians.

Agents and process of change: MoA will provide technical assistance and informational encouragement for small-holders to organize cooperatives or to align themselves with nuclear farms, where feasible, in order to more efficiently participate in markets for inputs and outputs. Cooperatives and nuclear farms will become the main conduit for socio-economic development in agriculture, contributing to improved livelihoods and poverty reduction. The MoA will work with local farm organizations and plantation operators to decide jointly on the mode of intervention that will be most effective in each area.

Outcome indicators (by 2017): Increased productivity, output, domestic sales and exports of agricultural products-crops, livestock and tree products. Increased overall and irrigated crop-production acreage. Increased volume and value of fishery output. Reduced rice import bill. Rising incomes for small-holders and fishers. Improved household nutrition, especially for vulnerable households. Increased number and viability of agriculture and fishery associations, with participation of women and youth.

Priority interventions: MoA will evaluate and further implement the successful features of the program, started during the 150 Days, to purchase designated food crops from small farmers to create jobs, revitalize agriculture and extend soft loans to farmers. MoA programs will continue to address the training needs of farmers with research and extension services and improve small-holders' access to credit and agricultural machinery through cooperatives, nuclear farms,34 and rental services. Since improved agriculture technologies are a public good, especially for small-holders, MoA will sponsor research that is relevant to them. MPW will address the infrastructure needs for transportation. Storage and trucking will come from the private sector and cooperatives, which the Government will encourage with appropriate regulations, along with improved roads. The Government will also develop product standards to be at par with those of competing imports and will promote their adoption. Liberia will develop its agro-industry to enhance penetration in domestic markets, increase food security for the population and reach overseas markets.

34 Nuclear farms are large farms, e.g., for tree crops, that will provide technical, marketing and credit services to smallholders that grow the same crops in the surrounding area.

The MoA, in partnership with other stakeholders will work on the following: regulation and inspection; maintenance of strategic food reserves; provision of market information; and financing the control of pests and farm diseases. The Government will promote the formation of cooperative societies and nuclear farms in various aspects of agriculture in order disseminate production and marketing information, to improve irrigation, and to facilitate the purchase of seeds and fertilizer, rental of machines, marketing, storage, credit and other agriculture related activities, such as transportation. Rather than subsidizing these services and intermediate inputs, the Government is initiating the supply process so that volumes grow to the point where unit prices at delivery are close enough to world prices so that Liberian farmers can compete with imports.

For the rubber and palm oil subsectors, the Government will support technical assistance to small producers, perhaps in partnership with the large enterprises that have considerable technical expertise and can function as nuclear farms. Regulation of the plantation side will assure environmental sustainability and proper treatment of workers.

The fisheries subsector will focus on community-based resource management to sustainably improve catches. The Government will promote aquaculture development and restock natural water bodies with fish seed. It will work with private entrepreneurs to develop more efficient processing facilities and improved distribution networks. It will continue active participation in the ongoing West Africa Regional Fisheries Program to reduce illegal fishing offshore and improve regulatory framework.

Box 9.5 below lists some of the costed priority interventions in the Agriculture and Food Security Sector.

9.5 FORESTRY-DEVELOPMENT AND PROTECTION

Liberia's forests are of global importance to conservation-the country possesses over 40 percent of the Upper Guinea rainforests in coastal West Africa-and they are also a vital source of food, medicines,

Box 9.5: Costed Priority Agriculture and Food Security Sector Interventions • Train farmers in high yielding planting methods • Train farmers in integrated plant nutrients and pest management methods, e.g., rice, cassava, corn and vegetable crops • Promote and establish fertilizer distribution points in each county • Establish service provision centers and machinery hire purchase and lease schemes in each county, for power tillers, tractors, seeders, harvesters, threshers, etc • Support universities and colleges to introduce graduate level training and broaden undergraduate education in agricultural disciplines such as fisheries, animal husbandry, and post-harvest technologies • Implement credit scheme for smallholder farmers

building materials and ecosystem services. Bush meat, charcoal and wood planks are vital to the livelihoods of rural Liberians and provide income to hunters, charcoal makers, sawyers, intermediate buyers and market agents for international markets.

The forestry sector has the potential to significantly contribute to poverty reduction and economic growth-including from international carbon financing opportunities-but it is currently recovering from decades of mismanagement and abuses that culminated in UN sanctions against the export of Liberian timber from 2003 to 2006. Significant policy, legal and institutional reforms led to the lifting of UN sanctions, and a new roadmap for forest sector development, the 2007 National Forest Strategy, was developed to broaden and balance commercial aspects with community and conservation objectives (the 3-C approach).

Since 2007 there has been limited recovery of production primarily for domestic use-informal production of lumber, charcoal and fuel wood. Less than 2 percent of the estimated timber production was exported from 2007-11. During 2007-9, the Forestry Development Authority (FDA), in collaboration with international and local CSOs and the World Bank, conducted a Strategic Environment Assessment of the forestry sector. The assessment noted an under-valuation of forest economic benefits and financial opportunities, such that forest management decisions tend to be biased towards commercial logging and stakeholder groups who benefit from logging. This forest policy strategy missed potential revenue generating and carbon-financing opportunities and undervalued non-timber forest products and services.

Goal: To integrate the community, conservation and commercial aspects (3-C strategy) of forestry to contribute sustainably to reducing poverty, improving livelihoods and the quality of rural life and increasing the ecological services provided by Liberia's forests.

Constraints: An overemphasis on the commercial and export opportunities of the forestry sector; a largely unregulated informal forestry sector; the government's inadequate monitoring and regulatory capacity; lack of adequate transport infrastructure; unclear land-use rights in forest areas; and insufficient stakeholder engagement and public understanding of the importance of sustainable forest management. Inconsistent policies and lack of coordination with neighboring countries have also contributed to problems.

Strategic objectives: Develop community and private-sector forest enterprises to increase incomes, provide jobs for communities, including women and youth, and increase government revenues. Expand sustainably harvested forest flora and fauna production for domestic and export markets through improved user rights, increased community participation and sustainable forest management. Minimize illegal harvesting of forest resources; assimilate, strengthen the informal forestry sector and strengthen trans-border conservation through collaborative agreements with neighboring countries. Build technical capacity of and improve coordination among government agencies, communities and civil society.

Agents and process for change: The FDA will collaborate with the LEITI, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) to create the capacity to monitor and regulate the forestry sector and inform the public about expansion of the forestry sector and its impact on society and the environment. The FDA, Land Commission, MLME, and the courts will coordinate efforts to resolve land allocation issues, such as between timber concessionaires and local communities. FDA will work with MPW, NPA and MPEA to improve transport infrastructure for forestry production, taking into account the growth corridors for other economic sectors.

Outcome indicators (by 2017): Increased number of viable community and private-sector forestry enterprises. Increased forest production, exports, value-added and employment, including of youth, women and other vulnerable groups, as confirmed by the Timber chain-of-custody process. Increased revenue to government, as confirmed by LEITI and including carbon credits. Increased forest area under legal protection and reduced illegal harvesting of forest resources, deforestation and trade of forest products (including across international borders), as confirmed by the Forest Monitoring Program implemented through the FCPF. Increased involvement and effectiveness of community groups in forestry management.

Priority interventions: To implement the 3-C approach in the next five years, the Government will: (a) ensure sustainable and effective commercial production from existing forest areas already under license (1.1 million hectares) and bring into production the remaining forest areas designated in the Forest Strategy for commercial use (1.3 million hectares) through production arrangements that clarify tenure and ownership, and assure equitable benefit sharing among all stakeholders and greater opportunity for community co-management of commercial forests. It will also (b) expand protection up to 1.3 million hectares of forest through a landscape-scale approach to the conservation of forests and forest ecosystem services. And it will (c) adopt sustainable forest management arrangements for production, conservation and protection that recognize and build upon community land and forest resource rights, maintain biodiversity, minimize economic dislocation and ensure the equitable sharing of benefits among forest communities, while enhancing their role in forest governance and management. The Government will comply fully with the Voluntary Partnership Agreement Enhancement, using the timber chain-of-custody process for all production. The Government will develop collaborative agreements with neighboring countries for the establishment of trans-boundary conservation areas and agreeing on common management practices.

The FDA will strengthen its implementation capacity through improved financing and revenue retention arrangements (including fiscal reforms to the current concession system) and through the appointment of a second Deputy Managing Director who is responsible for FDA's forestry program. The FDA will work with LISGIS to maintain an updated database of forest management information and will share it in a timely manner with international and national universities, research institutions, companies and other stakeholders-especially outside of Monrovia. It will strengthen its institutional and personnel capacities for sustainable forest management and those of EPA, local training and academic institutions, and other forest related stakeholders. Public awareness programs and training, including in schools, will better inform the public about the role of the FDA, the benefits of the 3-C approach, forestry laws and regulations, and the importance and benefits of sustainable forest management.

Recognizing that rural livelihoods are intrinsically linked to these forests, the FDA will undertake a consultative review of the proposed protected area program, seeking to maximize the opportunities for multiple use and co-management, and minimize the economic dislocation of affected communities.

9.6 MINERAL DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT

Liberia has great mineral wealth-iron ore, gold, diamonds, and potentially oil and natural gas, which are currently under exploration. The challenge is to use them for the common good, rather than enrichment for the elite, as was often the case in the past. The large-scale part of the mineral extraction sector made significant progress during the first PRS by attracting local and foreign investors and yielding fiscal revenue. However, providing more employment and capacity building for Liberians as well as domestic purchases of inputs at the large enterprises remains problematic. Informal small-scale mining, mainly gold and diamonds, has also grown although its size is not well recorded. Due to inefficient practices, recovery of gold from alluvial gravel is minimal, currently 30-40 percent. Additionally, health and environmental hazards from mercury and other substances are substantial. The Government recently established a regulatory framework for environmental management and sustainable development in the mineral extraction sector.

Goal: To promote sustainable, transparent and well-managed exploitation of Liberia's mineral resources and an equitable distribution of the benefits among citizens.

Constraints: The extreme enclave nature of the iron ore mining and off-shore petroleum operations; the dispersion and informal traditions of informal mining sector; and the weakness of government information systems and monitoring capacity for the mining sector. The absence of uniform mining regulations and standardized enforcement mechanisms hinders effective monitoring by the Inspectorate Bureau at the MLME and makes it difficult to bring concessions into compliance. Overlapping of strategic functions contributes to poor coordination among agencies involved with the sector. Although regulations for exploration exist, the Liberian Geological Survey (LGS) lacks the logistical capacity to monitor concessions. The small-scale, informal mining sector operates in diverse and uncertain locations, which makes it difficult to monitor or control. Further, LGS lacks capacity to keep a database on the production of gold, diamonds, and other minerals.

Strategic objectives: To spread the benefits of the concessions beyond the mining enclaves, regulations will assure that mining operations observe environmental and worker-safety regulations, including elimination of child labor. Mining operations will contribute to fiscal revenue and the expansion of employment and enterprises in the rest of the economy. The Government will continue to follow the rules of LEITI and will strengthen CSOs monitoring of concession agreements, mineral revenues and regulatory compliance to assure fiscal transparency. It will set regulations and negotiate the terms of concessions so that the mining companies' investments in power and transport (rail) infrastructure will allow other sectors to also use some of the facilities on a cost-sharing basis. Strengthening the small-scale mining sector will help reduce poverty by providing job opportunities, income and commercial activities as well as reduce urban in-migration.

Agents and process for change: The National Bureau of Concessions will negotiate concessions with mining and energy companies and, along with LEITI and the Inspectorate Bureau at MLME, will monitor their implementation (as detailed in Chapter 11). Development partners will provide training and technical assistance to the two bureaus to enable them carry out their mandates. For large concessions, the National Bureau of Concessions will coordinate with MoF and the Executive Mansion, due to the fiscal importance of mining revenues, and with the Land Commission and MIA, due to the importance of managing territorial claims between concessions and indigenous communities. For small-scale mining, the MLME will take the lead in formulating and implementing regulations, in coordination with the EPA and MIA, which will work with rural communities in mineral areas.

Outcome indicators (by 2017): Mineral exports and concessions revenue to government will grow, and will be fully reported on the LEITI website and elsewhere. There will be fewer instances of environmental degradation and worker safety problems. Agreements will exist for other users to share some of the electric generation and rail transport infrastructure built for the mining sector; electric power sharing will have begun. More small-scale miners will register their operations, pay required taxes, and comply with regulations. Inspections will increase, with reduced corruption, as evidenced in surveys.

Priority interventions: The Government will encourage small-scale miners to organize into cooperatives and provide them with safety and environmental awareness training and other technical assistance, so that they operate legally, safely and efficiently. Improvements require training and support, as well as enforcement of existing codes. Key challenges are to (a) make cooperatives and government involvement attractive to the presently independent miners; and (b) prevent this government regulation from leading to inefficiency and corruption.

The Government will improve monitoring mechanisms and inter-agency coordination and provide more adequate logistical and human resource support to monitoring agencies, including MLME, LISGIS, Bureau of Concessions, Land Commission, and EPA. To acquire adequate data on the mineral resources and mining activities, the Government will conduct a five-year geological and mineral exploration program to strengthen its bargaining power in negotiations with concessionaires-to increase revenue, employment, and infrastructure development.35

For the large-scale operations, the concessions agreements will contain environment protection conditions, and the Government will call on international help to monitor and enforce compliance. LEITI will also address compliance, as well as the issues of transparency on management of revenue streams. The Government will conduct public information campaigns and develop regulations and sanctions to keep environmental abuses in check.

9.7 CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT NEEDS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION SECTORS

The locally created results framework for the economic transformation pillar presents common capacity constraints and challenges at the institutional level involving both state and non-state actors, involving primarily:

 Weak achievement of outcomes as reflected in limited access to finance, low productivity levels in all production sectors;

 Weak operational efficiencies as shown in unclear, outdated and overlapping roles of MACs, and archaic organizational structures, deficient infrastructure (especially involving roads and energy);

35 The only reliable data on the mineral potential of the country come from exploration in the early 1970s by the

Liberian Geological Survey (LGS, now part of LISGIS) and the United States Geological Survey. LISGIS needs to authenticate the limited data now being provided by private exploration companies.

 Lack of clarity of stakeholder rights and responsibilities, resulting in poor land use, poor accountability of MACs;

 Weak commitment of political and social leaders to developing, approving, implementing, monitoring and evaluating key economic policies, strategies, and regulations.

Accordingly, the AfT design process has identified priority "transformational" types of interventions aimed at empowering strategic local agents of change (involving private sector, CSOs, government sector) who would help achieve enhanced intermediate outcomes and economic sector goals, including:

• Developing and disseminating new know-how for promoting enhanced economic performance by diverse stakeholders (e.g., expanding access to finance; generation, dissemination adoption of enhanced MSMEs and agricultural technologies; establishment of commercial courts; improving land administration systems);

• Promoting in a participatory, transparent and inclusive manner the formulation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of improved and updated policies and strategies covering all economic sectors, which could be enhanced and made accountable by strengthened MACs, public-private partnerships, and well organized and strengthened non-state networks, coalitions and public awareness campaigns (e.g., MSMEs, agriculture, forestry, energy, roads and transport, mining).

CHAPTER 10. PILLAR III-HUMAN DEVELOPMENT

Human development is central to Liberia's transformation agenda, which seeks to provide opportunities for all.

Goal: To improve quality of life by investing in more accessible and higher quality education; affordable and accessible quality healthcare; social protection for vulnerable citizens; and expanded access to healthy and environmentally-friendly water and sanitation services.

The human development agenda includes pragmatic economic priorities for human development as well as rights-based imperatives, in order to have an impact in the short term and set the stage for medium- to long-term improvements. The pragmatic priorities for economic growth and transformation concern building human resources in knowledge and skills that people need to be productive citizens. Investing in human development will create a pool of qualified and trained Liberians to support economic growth and to benefit from it. The rights-based dimension reflects people's rights to basic services as part of the process of social inclusion for nation building.

Table 10.1 lists the goals for each sector in Pillar III-education, health and social welfare, social protection, and water and sanitation. The indicators in these sectors are prominent in the HDI and the MDGs as key dimensions of Liberia's goal of becoming a middle-income country. This chapter discusses each sector and closes with Table 10.2 summarizing the goals, strategic objectives, and outcomes to be evidenced for the four HD sectors. While there is some repetition of the HDI and MDGs variables, it is important to discuss them specifically in the context of the corresponding sector strategies.

Table 10.1: Sector Goals for Human Development

A. EDUCATION (MoE): Ensure equal access to a high quality free and compulsory basic education and a variety of post-basic education and training opportunities that lead to an improved livelihood.

10.1 EDUCATION

Education is a high priority for Liberia, both for today's school-age children and to provide for the large population of older youth who missed out on school during the war. While laudable efforts are being made to give the latter some form of training, the conventional approach used in most cases can be ineffective. Most young people have tasted life and do not want to return to the classroom. These youths have shown survival skills and the potential for experiential learning and making decision on their own. Training needs to recognize and build on these skills, rather than overlooking these youth who lack formal education. In post-crisis situations, the UNICEF concept of Talent Academies offers one positive avenue for youth.  

The Five-Year (2012-2017) Medium-term Plan for Education Reform and Development in Liberia focuses on restoring basic education (grades 1-9) through expanding access and improving the quality of education by rebuilding facilities, providing learning materials, training teachers, and introducing accelerated learning for older learners. The 2009 Education Sector Plan calls for a free and compulsory nine-year basic education, comprising six years of primary and three years of junior secondary education. In addition, the Education Reform Act of 2011 and the draft Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) Policy of 2011 provide a framework that includes pre-primary/early childhood education as well as post-basic education and skills development. Currently, a high percentage of children and adolescents are not in school, having either dropped out or never started. Liberian schools have a high percentage of over-aged learners (60 percent) and low efficiency in terms of repetition and poor learning achievement. A high percentage of the population is illiterate and unskilled, and the programs for adult basic education and training have been weak.

Goal: The goal of the education sector is to ensure equal access to a high-quality free and compulsory basic education and to a variety of post-basic education and training opportunities that lead to an improved livelihood and/or tertiary education.

Constraints: Inadequate resources and lack of capacity (both teachers and managers) to provide basic education services to all communities, especially remote rural ones; a centralized system that is inequitable, inefficient and unaccountable to beneficiaries; lack of school readiness for many children, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds; a challenging backlog of out-of-school children and adolescents who need alternative education services; a fragmented and dysfunctional TVET subsector that does not address the skills required by young people in Liberia; weak provision of adult literacy or adult basic education and training programs; and a higher education subsector that needs reform in order to provide appropriate leadership.

Strategic objectives: Ensure equitable access to free basic education for all children and youth, including girls and the disabled, with improved outcomes. Improve quality, relevance and accessibility of secondary, tertiary, vocational/technical education programs and to alternative basic education programs for out-of-school adolescents and youth. Efficiently strengthen educational services and information management at the national level, with focus at the community level. Improve Parent-Teacher Associations (PTAs) and national oversight, standards and coordination to ensure quality education; including non-government early child care and development (ECCD) programs for children aged 0 to 5 years. Increase numbers and improve competencies of teachers in formal schools and alternative basic education programs.

Agents and process for change: The MoE and MIA will work with all counties and districts to implement the Education Reform Act of 2011. This includes establishing a network of county and district education offices and school boards to strengthen service delivery and local management. The MoE will liaise with LISGIS to develop the data systems to implement the M&E process for the sector. It will work with early childhood development providers, CSOs and community leaders to develop quality programs to prepare children for first grade. It will work with regional teacher training institutes (TTIs) to improve the skills and performance standards of teachers at all levels, especially the secondary level. The MoE will establish the National Council of Higher Education (NCHE) and implement an accreditation process for TTIs and other institutions of higher education. It will work with the TTIs to procure textbooks, to implement programs to improve teaching standards, and to include alternate basic education (ABE) and TVET. It will establish a TVET commission and support implementation of a TVET policy to improve coordination and quality in those programs. The MOE will work with the Ministry of Gender and Development (MoGD) to improve access to school for all school-age children, especially girls and those in disadvantaged communities.

The MoE will work with MPW, the country education boards and CSOs to build or rehabilitate school buildings and basic utilities. The National Commission for Higher Education (NCHE) and higher education institutes will partner with the private sector to extend post-secondary services in underserved regions.

Outcome indicators (by 2017): Successful implementation will result in a reformed higher education subsector, providing leadership for excellence in a decentralized education system that delivers quality basic education services and TVET programs to all learners. Key indicators include: Increased net and gross enrollment rates and completion rates for male and females at every education level, especially in counties with initially low rates. Improved performance on standardized tests at all school levels and counties. Increased numbers of teachers with certified training. An increased number of schools that meet the minimum standards for safety, sanitary facilities and educational materials. Increased percent of both female and male graduates from vocational and higher education institutions that secure a job in their field.

Priority interventions: Expanding public provision of basic education while enabling more private, faith-based and community-based provision (including ECCD); setting standards and providing quality assurance; sensitization, advocacy and communication with parents and other stakeholders, including nutrition promotion; strengthening collaboration and coordination between education providers and beneficiary communities; training and accreditation of teachers/instructors at all levels and ECCD caregivers; establishing and supporting teacher resource centers; development of assessment indicators; improving teacher education/training programs and facilitating continuous professional development. Also, as part of the decentralization process outlined in Chapter 12, the MoE will establish county education offices and county and district resource centers in all 15 counties-training key staff at these levels, building capacity of PTAs, as well as training supervisors in quality assurance monitoring, evaluation and accountability. Key technical functions like curriculum development, research, testing and examinations will be moved from the central MoE and into specialist centers as part of a de-concentration process. The government will integrate ABE into teacher education programs to provide qualified teachers who can implement valuable ABE. Support will also be provided for placement of ABE learners into workforce schemes. As started in the 150 Days, the government will rehabilitate and expand facilities and options for vocational and technical training, and will develop an interactive information system to link young Liberians with available TVET programs and employment options, as well as to link employers with TVET programs and trainees. The NCHE will work to provide incentives for private providers of higher education (including community colleges) to extend higher education programs to counties in underserved regions. In order to provide further options for higher education, the NCHE will develop a policy for distance learning in higher education.

10.2 HEALTH AND SOCIAL WELFARE

Like other sectors in Liberia, the health and social welfare sector was crippled during the years of civil conflict-in terms of facilities destroyed, loss of skilled personnel and lack of supplies. Since 2003 the sector has made a steady recovery and has progressed from emergency status to reconstruction and normal development. Key indicators of health and social welfare in the population and for system performance have improved, especially during the first PRS when 63 percent of sector deliverables were achieved through the National Health Policy and Plan (NHPP). The NHPP was designed to restore basic health services that had been destroyed during the conflict, and so lay the foundations for a system that can provide accessible and affordable quality health care services to all Liberians.

Under NHPP, child health improved markedly. Under-5 mortality rates declined and under-5 malaria prevalence fell to 32 percent in 2011 from 66 percent in 2005. The number of functional health facilities increased by 64 percent, from 354 to 550, and facilities offering the Basic Package of Health Services (BPHS) increased from 36 percent in 2008 to 84 percent in 2011. The workforce also increased from around 5,000 to about 8,000. However these gains remain skewed in favor of urban populations and those

B ox 10.0: Costed

Priority Education Sector Interventions

• Make County School Boards functional

• Train and deploy county staff

• Train teachers at all levels using identified training models

• Establish a national commission to oversee TVET development and governance

• Construct primary and secondary schools who can afford private health care provisions. For instance, 85 percent of urban households are within one hour's walk of a health facility while two-thirds of rural households travel more than an hour to reach a health facility. For childbirth, 63 percent of deliveries in urban areas are facility-based compared with 25 percent in rural areas; similarly 77 percent of urban deliveries are done by skilled service providers compared to only 32 percent of rural deliveries. Other health and social welfare problems persist despite the achievements of the NHPP. More than 40 percent of children suffer from chronic malnutrition, largely due to poor feeding practices. Up to 30 percent of under-5 deaths are attributed to malnutrition, which also deprives surviving children of optimum development. Generally there is low coverage, low quality, unpredictable financing, and poor use of health services. Malaria still accounts for 38 percent of the outpatient attendance and 42 percent of inpatient deaths in Liberia. About 4,300 children are classified as orphans and around 92,000 people (mainly adults) are living with disabilities (Ministry of Health and Social Welfare [MoHSW] statistics).

In 2011, the MoH published the National Health and Social Welfare Policy and Plan 2011-2021 (NHSWPP), which sets the sector strategy for 2012-17 and beyond.

Goal: To Improve the health and social welfare status of the population of Liberia on an equitable basis.

Constraints: The nation's health, nutrition and social welfare system crumbled during the civil war; the health-sector work force is still depleted; poor road conditions hamper delivery of services and supplies; financing is unpredictable due to low budget allocations and uncertain development partner funding; and there is imbalance between the size and staffing of facilities and the catchment populations they are supposed to serve. Current workforce growth is skewed towards nurses and nursing aides, and there is low retention of skilled workers due to unattractive conditions of service and unattractive salary.

Strategic objectives: The NHSWPP sets out three strategic objectives for health36: (a) Increase access to and utilization of quality health and social welfare services delivered close to communities endowed with the necessary resources and offering a comprehensive package of interventions of proven effectiveness. (b) Make health and social welfare services more responsive to people's needs, demands and expectations by transferring management and decision making to lower administration levels while ensuring a fair degree of equity. (c) Make health care and social welfare available to all of Liberia's population, regardless of an individual's position in society, at a cost that is affordable to the country.

Agents and process for change: The MoHSW will lead in implementing plans for expanded staffing (coordinated with Civil Service Agency) and facilities (coordinated with MPW). The MoHSW will also coordinate with county health teams to build networks of community health volunteers and to increase awareness of the availability and need to use community health facilities and programs, such as immunization, insecticide-treated bed nets, trained and certified midwives, and emergency care for children with fever. The MoHSW will work with the National Drug Service to assure the efficient flow of medical supplies to all health service points and facilities.

Priority interventions: The Government will establish a decentralized network for health services comprising health service points for populations of less than 3,500 within 5 kilometers; health clinics for populations between 3,500 and 12,000; health centers serving populations up to 40,000; and county

hospitals for up to 200,000. It will provide primary health care (including nutrition promotion) at health service points; plus in-patient, emergency and basic OB-GYN services at health clinics; plus general surgery, pediatrics, and general medicine at the level of county hospitals; plus tertiary services at the four regional referral hospitals and the national referral hospital-John F. Kennedy Memorial Hospital. It will also increase and retain qualified health workers by providing more attractive pay and working conditions, including incentives for those working in difficult locations. Government will deploy social workers at health facilities in rural areas and contract out institution-based social services. Extending the program from the 150 Days, MoHSW will equip 150 health clinics with solar refrigerators to ensure the stability of vaccines.

Box 10.1 below lists some costed priority interventions in the Health Sector.

10.1: Costed

Priority Health Sector Interventions

• Construction of health facilities

• Training specialize healthcare workers (PA, CMs, Nurses, Doctors)

• Procure the essential and necessary medical and drugs supply and equipment for the health system

• Increased coverage to comprehensive and basic Emergency Obstetric and Newborn as well as PMTCT

10.3 SOCIAL PROTECTION

Social protection is a new and relatively underdeveloped policy area in Liberia and it is a long way from reaching those most in need. As a country recovering from more than 15 years of civil conflict, the need for social protection in Liberia is large and multi-faceted. Around 300,000 households (48 percent) are classified as being in extreme poverty, and a further 16 percent are below the absolute poverty line with the risk of slipping into extreme poverty. An estimated 85 percent of the active work force has only vulnerable employment-without access to a pension, insurance policies, sickness benefits or job security. Vulnerable groups, such as people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV), persons with disabilities and orphaned children, face risks of violence, exploitation, discrimination, abuse and neglect. About 4,300 children are classified as orphans, and 92,000 people (mainly adults) live with disabilities. Other vulnerable groups also need attention: children and adolescents in contact with the law or subject to unlawful child labor and those trafficked for various purposes.

In 2010, a National Steering Committee for Social Protection was established, chaired by the Minister of Planning and Economic Affairs and having a secretariat housed in that ministry. In 2012, a draft national social protection policy and strategy was developed after a broad based, participatory consultative process involving a wide range of stakeholders. To date, most intervention programs in this sector have been supported by development partners, but the Government is aware of the need to make appropriate budget allocations in order to take national ownership of programs in this sector. However, in the short term, donor support, especially for building an efficient and effective social protection system with the capacity for an efficient and effective delivery of social protection services, will be critical. Elements of social protection interventions (e.g., abolition of school fees, as well as school feeding, and health fee waivers) are already in place through other sectors and for other reasons than extreme poverty and vulnerability. Government will use this multi-sector approach to support and finance social protection interventions, the rationales for which go beyond the need to address extreme poverty and vulnerability. Still, the social protection programs will serve as the bulwark of the Government's commitment to protect very vulnerable households against the worst effects of economic turbulence.

Liberia is piloting a Social Cash Transfer program (SCT) in Bomi County to provide cash to households that are below the poverty line and are labor constrained. This refers to household where no able bodied household member in the age group 19-64 is fit for work (are chronically ill and/or are child/female/elderly headed).. The Social Cash Transfer pilot program is currently donor funded and administered by UNICEF under the Ministry of Gender and Development. Following a major evaluation, the Government will consider mechanisms to scale up this scheme and others, such as micro-credits and public works to assist the most vulnerable households improve their livelihoods and graduate from extreme poverty. Meanwhile, additional funding has now been obtained to extend the program to Maryland County and eventually to Grand Kru County. Such safety net initiatives are critical for signaling the nation's concern and strengthening the social contract.

Goal: Build a social protection system for improved protection of the poorest and most vulnerable households and groups from poverty, deprivation and hunger, and enhanced resilience to risks and shocks.

Constraints: Outside of a small cadre of social workers, there is no trained pool of workers dedicated to social protection. Responsibility for service delivery is dispersed across different ministries and agencies. The most vulnerable households are typically without labor and tend to be susceptible to hunger, malnutrition and food insecurity, as well as not having access to other basic services. These households are typically in remote locations that are inaccessible for much of the year. They are also likely to suffer from limited local food production and high price volatility, resulting in double jeopardy for the most vulnerable.

Strategic objectives: Adopt a clear and comprehensive policy and fiscally sustainable system for social protection by the government to benefit the poorest and most vulnerable households and groups. Improve social service capacity and operations nationally and at the county level, including participation of CSOs and communities. Increase employment readiness, especially of youth, by promoting behavioral changes. Improve livelihoods of the extreme poor, youth, and the most vulnerable households and groups.

Agents and process for change: An Inter-Ministerial Committee of various ministries and key stakeholders will be formed to oversee social protection programs and increase public awareness of their benefits. The MoPEA will chair and will continue to play a central role, along with the Ministry of Gender and Development (MoGD), MoHSW, MoE, MOYS and key donor partners. They will work with the legislature and NGOs to review legislation on social protection entitlement and programs and to build a consensus on the changes needed for an effective strategy and resource mobilization required to build a robust social protection system. Youth groups, in conjunction with formal private sector employers, will collaborate on creating the training youth need to increase their professionalism and employment readiness. Informal workers from the poorest and most vulnerable households and groups will be supported in accessing social insurance and other schemes, including support for lean season safety nets to mitigate the impact of seasonal shortages and high food prices on vulnerable rural and urban households.

Outcome indicators (by 2017): There will be fewer households in extreme poverty or with inadequate nutrition. More poor, vulnerable households and groups, especially women, youth and children will have access to and utilize basic social services and social insurance. The social protection system and programs will be fiscally sustainable.

Priority interventions: The Government will adopt a national social protection policy and develop an implementation plan with a resource mobilization strategy. Coordination will be strengthened and a national database established to register and track beneficiaries of social protection interventions. It will support a range of social protection programs, including expanding the pilot cash transfer program started in the 150 Days, and implementing food-for-work schemes, and micro-credit programs. These will be designed to enable and motivate poor households to graduate from social cash transfer to a micro-credit scheme, as their circumstances change, or to enable individuals to progress from food-for-work to cash-paying jobs. Food supplementation programs will also be supported for children, pregnant women, and those affected by HIV and other illnesses such as TB in the most food insecure areas. The Government will also support school meals, provision of seeds and gardening tools to communities, school gardens, and poverty-targeted exemptions to save the vulnerable from paying user fees for public services such as health care. Government will establish official links between social workers and service delivery institutions, so they can negotiate access or entitlement for individuals/households to the social protection services they need. Government will also encourage higher education institutions to provide training of professionals to address the needs of poor and vulnerable Liberians.

Box 10.2 below lists some of the costed priority interventions in the Social Protection Sector.

10.4 WATER, SANITATION AND HYGIENE (WASH)

The already weak water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure in Liberia suffered deep destruction and collapse in many areas during the civil war. In Monrovia, household connections to piped water fell to one tenth of pre-conflict levels. With some recovery since 2003, an estimated 62 percent of the Liberian population now has access to protected water sources, mainly wells or boreholes with hand pumps, springs, and harvested rainwater. Only a third of the population has access to water sources with adequate yield all year round, however. Water safety is also threatened by unsafe storage practices, with an estimated 63 percent of households storing water in open containers, risking contamination.

The situation for sanitation is worse, with only 25 percent of households (53 percent urban and 17 percent rural) having access to improved sanitation. This threatens the gains from access to protected water sources. The prevalence of open defecation (77 percent of rural households and 30 percent of urban households) and lack of solid waste disposal or sewerage systems, poor drainage and poor disposal of garbage all pose contamination threats to drinking water. This has intensified the sense of squalor and poor quality of life, particularly for Liberians living in urban slum areas. Also, 43 percent of households in Liberia do not practice hand washing with soap, while 62 percent do not wash hands after using the toilet and a further 68 percent reported that they do not wash hands before eating. These trends put the health of communities at risk (especially under-5 children and the elderly) and erode the quality of life for Liberians through the following: lack of clean water for drinking and personal hygiene; the debilitating impact of water-borne diseases; the time spent (by women and girls) in fetching water; and the general malaise of living in environmental squalor.

Box 10.2: Costed

Priority Social Protection Sector Interventions

• Recruit and train 250 total social workers and para-professionals in both centralized and decentralized contexts

• Expansion of emergency employment schemes for youth in vulnerable HHs, e.g., food for work schemes, temporary employment

In Monrovia, a solid waste disposal program has made reasonable progress, including establishment of an environmentally acceptable landfill, but the rest of the country has no disposal program. It will be critical to develop a comprehensive policy on solid waste for Liberia, as well as to set up a National Water Resources and Sanitation Board to address the fragmentation in this sector.

In 2011, Liberia issued its official WASH Compact: Water and Sanitation for All: A Global Framework for Action, on which this section is based.

Goal: To increase access to safe water supply and sanitation and improve hygiene practices.

Constraints: Lack of financing for infrastructure investments has hindered improvement of water supply, waste disposal, garbage disposal, and drainage. There is limited human resource and technical capacity in WASH, and there is no board or similar body to coordinate the operations of the sector. Service coverage needs to be multi-dimensional so that advances in water supply are not compromised by negative trends in other areas such as solid waste disposal or hygiene behavior. Many communities are resistant to change of health habits and practices; they adhere to unsafe hygiene practices due to cultural traditions and lack of means to change. When people lack clean water, soap, or solid waste disposal, they find it difficult to change their hygiene behavior, even when they are aware of good practices.

Strategic objectives: Manage, expand and sustain Liberia's WASH services through a clear, functional and inclusive WASH governance structure and with strengthened operational guidelines, training and financing. Expand equitable access to environmentally-friendly and sustainable water, sanitation services and solid waste management-including for the poorest and most vulnerable communities. Increase safe hygiene practices (e.g., hand washing and reduced open defecation), and strengthening community organizations and schools. Improve WASH sector capacity and engagement with stakeholders, and strengthen WASH monitoring and information management systems. The following are based on the four commitments in Liberia's 2011 WASH Compact: Establish and strengthen institutional capacity; ensure equity and prioritized service provision; develop a monitoring system; and improve sector financing mechanisms.

Agents and process for change: The Government will establish and make functional the National Water Resource and Sanitation Board (NWRSB), which will implement sector policy and provide technical support to municipalities and rural water and sanitation boards. The NWRSB will coordinate WASH sector activities of Liberia Water and Sanitation Commission, MPW, and MoE, MLME and LWSC will work with them on institutional capacity building. Further, NWRSB will strengthen its own M&E units and will establish information management systems that feed information to the national WASH Information Center. The NWRSB will also work with MoE, the Liberia Water and Sewer Corporation (LWSC), CSOs and municipalities to educate households on safe hygiene practices. CSOs will advocate for sufficient attention and funding for the sector.

Outcome indicators by 2017: A major increase in the share of households, institutions and communities, both urban and rural, which have access to improved WASH facilities. Infection rates from water-borne diseases, malaria and other environment-related diseases will decline. Disposal of solid waste in unmanaged sites (such as streams and backyards) will decline.

Priority interventions: The NWRSB will be established with a clear mandate, adequate personnel, appropriate training, and sustainable financing. The NWRSB and its subsidiaries (National Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion Committee, Water Supply and Sanitation Commission, Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Bureau, and Directorate of Community Mobilization and Hygiene Promotion) will implement and monitor appropriate WASH standards and regulation protocols. At national and county levels, government will establish and implement a prioritized sector investment plan to increase water and sanitation services (including for liquid and solid waste). Government, in collaboration with donors, will establish a pooled funding mechanism for the sector. It will strengthen the entities and institutions responsible for providing WASH services, especially at the municipal level. It will also support WASH services in schools and health facilities, including information and advisory services to improve hygiene behaviors.

Box 10.3 below lists some of the costed priority interventions in the Social Protection Sector.

10.5 IMPLICATIONS OF THE HUMAN DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY FOR OTHER PILLARS

Each of the four human development sectors includes the need for capacity building. Planning at Liberia's universities and other higher education institutions will aim to fill the need for training of teachers, administrators and other education specialists; training of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and other health personnel; training of staff for social protection; and training of staff for WASH.

A more comprehensive and cost effective approach to human development will require exploiting synergies across all sectors. In this regard, the Government will support such measures as school meals; nutrition promotion and WASH education in schools; school vegetable gardens; improved WASH infrastructure and practices in health care facilities; health checks in schools and use of mobile health clinics to serve schools and their catchment communities; and information and advisory services in health care facilities. These measures will strengthen the internal coherence within Pillar III, by exploiting the synergies that exist across contributing sectors.

All five pillar of the AfT have important synergies with each other-especially the Human Development and Economic Transformation sectors. A healthy workforce with good and relevant education and training are essential to reducing poverty through employment and growth. From the labor demand side,

Box 10.3: Costed

Priority Water and Sanitation Sector Interventions

• Refresh community management structures / systems and rehabilitate 3,000 rural water supplies

• 100% rehabilitation of water treatment plant in Monrovia (White Plains) & environs.

• Rehabilitate 100% of the Monrovia sewerage system   expanding MSMEs, industries, and the rest of the private sector will generate further employment opportunities, particularly for youth, and will increase the incentive for them to utilize education opportunities. Talent Academies will help utilize the technical and entrepreneurial untapped potential of Liberia's young people. Regulation and appropriate incentives that move informal businesses into the formal economy will improve the working conditions and health insurance for workers. From a public finance perspective, funding for the human development agenda will depend on economic transformation that generates tax and royalty revenue to pay for these government programs in the long run.

10.6 CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT NEEDS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR HUMAN DEVELOPMENT

The results framework that underpins the human development pillar presents common capacity constraints and challenges at the institutional level involving both state and non-state actors. These constraints and challenges include:

 Weak achievement of outcomes, as reflected in low access to, and low performance indicators in education (at all levels), health, social protection coverage (especially of very poor households), water supply and sanitation;

 Weak operational efficiencies, as shown in poor quality of provision and coordination of educational, health, social protection, water supply and sanitation services, reflecting inadequate numbers and quality of human resources;  Lack of clarity of stakeholder rights and responsibilities, as reflected in limited participation of local communities in assessing and overseeing human development programs, and weak governance structures (particularly involving water supply and sanitation institutions and services);

 Weak compatibility of social norms and values, as reflected in poor health-seeking behaviors due to cultural practices (e.g., unsafe child delivery practices, adherence to unsafe hygiene practices).

Accordingly, the AfT design process has identified priority "transformational" types of interventions aimed at empowering strategic local agents of change (involving private sector, CSOs, government sector) that would help achieve enhanced intermediate outcomes and medium-term sector goals, including:

• Providing responsive and effective training programs at various levels (national, county), which would lead to enhanced skills and know-how in key aspects of HD programs (e.g., enhanced capacity to develop and implement education curriculum reforms; customized training programs at national and local levels for teachers, health workers/service providers, social protection services, water supply and sanitation technical and administrative staff; enhanced human capacities to manage service performance tracking and management information systems in all HD sectors);

• Carrying out programs/activities that will increase community awareness of the importance and benefits of accessing enhanced educational, health, social protection, water supply/sanitation services, including the National Youth Capacity Development Initiative;

• Imparting programs/activities which will strengthen community leaders and CSO-based networks and coalitions (including their establishment, where needed) to promote enhanced and more accountable HD programs/services, at all levels, including greater non-state participation in the formulation, implementation and monitoring of enhanced HD policies and programs.

The Liberian Government introduced governance in the Lift Liberia PRS by noting that "the series of crises that besieged the Liberian nation over the last quarter century-from war and mismanagement to human rights abuses and deepening poverty-can be blamed largely on poor governance and disrespect for the rule of law." Despite the marked improvement and economic recovery and growth over the past five years, the economic growth would be unbalanced or unsustainable without reforms to governance and public institutions. Liberians' determination to address poverty is diluted when the Government is unable to translate popular will into action, or unable to allocate and manage public resources to deliver efficient and accountable services according to these priorities.

Goal: In partnership with citizens, create transparent, accountable and responsive public institutions that contribute to economic and social development as well as inclusive and participatory governance systems.

Implementation of a number of PRS reforms were stalled due to lack of alignment between the Government and donors; weak coordination and aid effectiveness; and weak commitment of political and social actors to take ownership and leadership of the reform process. These factors have served as major cross-cutting constraints to the translation of policies into effective actions. As civil society has a key role in furthering the governance strategy under the Agenda for Transformation, and the legislature and local populations all have an important role to play in the process, a central pillar objective is to create an imperative for change and build national ownership of the governance reform agenda. To do this, the Government, led by the MIA, will seek to put in place a multi-path communication plan that is essential for securing active engagement by key actors to ensure progress on key reforms. The Governance

Commission (GC) must help to develop closer relations among the people, the legislature and the administration. The result must be a broadly shared understanding of the need for reforms and strengthened will to implement such reforms, leading to public ownership and commitment to the PRS objectives.

Despite the strides of the Liberian Government and people in establishing and solidifying good governance under the PRS, governance remains a challenge that requires urgent and well-coordinated attention by various stakeholders-government, civil society, the private sector, and development partners. Table 11.1 summarizes the sector goals of Pillar IV.

Table 11.1: Goals for Governance and Public Sector Modernization

Pillar Goal: In partnership with citizens, create transparent, accountable and responsive public institutions that contribute to economic and social development as well as inclusive and participatory governance systems.

A. POLITICAL GOVERNANCE

Nation-building and Decentralization: Engage with citizens to ensure equitable, peaceful, transparent and inclusive democratic institutions and enhanced political governance at national and local levels.

B. PUBLIC SECTOR MODERNIZATION AND REFORM

Civil Service: Independent, accountable, merit-based and performance oriented, well-structured public sector with improved service delivery

C. ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE

Public Financial Management& Transparency: Strengthen public institutions to ensure revenues and government assets are well managed, free from corruption and monitored and increase transparency and accountability of public and private institutions.

Land Tenure and Use: Develop comprehensive national land tenure, including land use system, that will provide equitable access to land and security of tenure so as to facilitate inclusive, sustained growth and development, ensure peace and security and provide sustainable management of the environment

Concessions: Improve the negotiation, management and monitoring of concessions to ensure they contribute effectively to broad based economic and social development

11.1 POLITICAL GOVERNANCE

Despite the strides of the Government and people of Liberia in establishing and solidifying good governance under the PRS, governance still remains a big challenge. A partially successful national referendum and a turbulent second round of national and local elections demonstrate slow but steady progress toward democratic processes. Political governance in this pillar focuses on Nation-Building and Decentralization.

Nation-Building and Decentralization

Government has approved and launched a policy on decentralization and local governance aimed at facilitating popular participation, local initiative, greater transparency and accountability, especially in the provision of public goods and services. The policy, when codified, will also permit greater personal and economic freedom throughout the country. The Government has begun the process of de-concentration of some services to local levels. Since the transition from civil war, the Government has progressively devolved previously centralized decision and budgetary authority to MACs.

Sub-pillar Goal: Engage with citizens to ensure equitable, peaceful, transparent, and inclusive democratic institutions and enhanced political governance at national and local levels.

Constraints: Decentralization is a major, long-term undertaking, and ensuring participation of all stakeholders (including women and youth) is a challenge. The government is highly centralized, while at the local level there are too many small and fragmented political units that, for want of capacity and a clear mandate, would not support political and fiscal decentralization. As a nation, Liberia must draw together diverse identities that have led to social cleavages, reduce barriers that exclude segments of the population from economic and socio-political life, and thereby reduce incentives for conflict at the local and national levels, as described in Chapter 8 (Pillar I).

This process must begin at the local level, where citizens are most affected, and continue upwards to the national level. The first PRS only partially succeeded at this and its efforts must be continued.

Within the existing social and constitutional framework, decentralization efforts in the PRS were constrained by the 1986 Constitution, which does not provide a legal framework for decentralization measures. Getting such a legal framework will require a broad public debate to build support for a constitutional amendment. Many communities, however, lack the necessary information, and many citizens lack the civic education required to contribute to this debate. Proponents of incremental change could face a possible national fatigue with the referendum process. Also, judging from international experience, initial steps of reform may create interest groups that could oppose further steps that were originally envisioned. Finally, the decentralization process would be challenged even in its initial stages by the lack of physical and human infrastructure, management capability, and service delivery systems in the counties.

As an emerging democracy, Liberia must do more to improve citizens' participation in the democratic process.

Strategic objectives The strategic objective for this theme is to prepare for decentralization of administrative and fiscal capacity within Vision 2030. Decentralization is political (electoral), fiscal, and administrative, devolving both power and resources to local government units. To accomplish this goal requires political will and leadership and involvement of the citizenry to achieve the necessary amendments to the Constitution. De-concentration, and devolution of budget execution and service provision to the local level, is within administration power and has begun under PRS with the Ministry of Education, the establishment of regional security hubs in parallel with UNMIL's five regional justice and security hubs, and preparatory steps for the Ministry of Health. The strategy will continue under the AfT with Health, Security, and other functions, though specific steps will depend upon whether the electorate permits decentralization through reform of the 1986 Constitution. The development of local accountability for local public investment, service delivery, and asset management is further constrained by the lack of harmonization of significant county and local boundaries.

Agents and process of change: Change involves preparing for decentralization of administrative and fiscal capacity, electoral reforms, and constitutional review within Vision 2030. The Ministry of Internal Affairs will lead implementation of the decentralization program informed by the decentralization policy, strategic plans, and the Local Government Act.

The National Elections Commission will work to promote and ensure free, fair and transparent elections, and active citizens' participation in collaboration with civil society groups.

The Governance Commission will continue to promote awareness, acceptance, and observance of good governance within both the public and private sectors, through the conceptualization and design of policies and programs in consultation and/or collaboration with other public and private institutions.

Outcome indicators (by 2017): The interventions will increase citizens' participation in social and economic development, which will be shown by increased rates of voting and employment as indicators of citizen participation in social and economic development. There will also be substantial rates of participation in the review and amendment of the Constitution and implementing legislation across all counties by citizens and CSOs. Surveys will show that more citizens have information available on public policy issues, including decentralization; that citizens in all counties have an increased sense of shared nationhood and national identity; citizens will have a sense of increased participation in public service delivery decisions and that local service delivery agencies are responsive to their needs.

Priority interventions: Under this overarching strategy, the Government will progressively build the responsiveness and capacity of local government in the process of delegation of authority and deconcentration of each MAC. As a result of these interventions, an informed electorate may support fiscal, administrative, and political decentralization.

To complement the preparations for decentralization, in the next five years the decentralization program will seek to develop or provide the physical and human infrastructure that will support the process of decentralization. This includes the physical infrastructure for de-concentrated MACs, new local housing units for de-concentrated civil servants, and an agreement on county strategies to improve the skill base of local employees. Counties will be encouraged, with the assistance of the MIA and GC, to prepare their own roadmaps for de-concentrated service delivery, as initial steps in the transition to local shared governance. The result will be new systems, processes and procedures for planning and public financial management in each county. This will be supported in the long term by the design and establishment of new courses and a university-level degree program in local governance that will provide the qualified staff for devolved authority and capacity development in the counties.

Engagement with citizens will have several key outcomes. The overriding result will be to enhance the shared nationhood and national identity among all Liberians. The AfT seeks to improve citizen participation in social and economic development. Regarding more specific interventions, the result will be a new understanding of recommendations to amend the Constitution to encourage citizen participation leading to draft legislation, raised awareness around the benefits of boundary harmonization as well as harmonization of fragmented political and administrative units to support viable decentralized social and economic development. The capacity building will prepare the way for decentralized civic and political engagement by the young, and through them, future generations.

11.2 PUBLIC SECTOR MODERNIZATION AND REFORM

Government must have a strong and capable public sector in order to fulfill its task of upholding the rights of the Liberian people and increasing the welfare of the nation. In order to achieve the development goals identified throughout this strategy, the Government must invest in the ongoing development of a modern and capable public sector and continue to build its own institutional and human capacity in order to improve the quality and the distribution of services delivered to all Liberians.

Civil Service

Mismanagement of public institutions and years of the civil crisis created severe deficiencies in the capacity of the Liberian public sector and eroded the public's confidence in their Government's commitment and ability to serve the people.

Significant progress has been made over recent years to repair these deficiencies, and the civil service has benefitted from fundamental reform and development during the PRS, but much more remains to be done. Through implementation of the PRS, the mandates and functions reviews of 12 key ministries were completed and there was a significant rationalization of the civil service.

On a separate track, key ministries such as Finance and Health have undertaken significant internal reforms. Human resource practices were widely professionalized, and civil service standards, policies and procedures were renewed. An overarching strategy for civil service reform was drafted and for the first time in decades, a clear trajectory for civil service reform was set. A far-reaching public financial management strategy (for 2011-14) was developed and implementation is underway.

Sub-pillar goal: An independent, accountable, merit-based and performance oriented, well-structured public sector with improved service delivery.

Constraints: Liberia still has a long way to travel along this trajectory. Several of the reform initiatives currently under implementation have neither a comprehensive framework to establish priorities and to achieve synergies and leverage their complementarities, nor planning linkages to assure that the budget as executed reflects AfT priorities, within existing resource limits. Despite the measures taken under PRS, overlapping mandates, unclear functions, weak organizational structures and politicized staff configurations continue to impede effective delivery of services, impede focus on priorities, and bloat an underperforming civil service. Attempts to address these constraints are further hampered by human resource practices featuring weak professional requirements and uneven compliance among MACs, by salary structures and rewards that are low and rarely linked to performance and by gender discrimination and sexual harassment that limit the participation of women in the civil service. Service delivery systems are vulnerable to corruption, recipients frequently must offer bribes to receive public services, and sanctions against such behavior are ineffective. Finally, performance reforms and efficiency gains achieved under PRS, for the most part, have not yet been extended to state-owned enterprises and autonomous agencies that serve the Liberian public; this is particularly true with respect to public financial management.

Strategic Objectives:  Build on the successes of public service reform so far, to continue to develop the capacity of the civil service, and to professionalize and modernize the public sector in order to enhance the quality of life of the Liberian people on a sustained basis. This strategy aims to achieve these objectives by creating a public sector that is increasingly:

• Independent from inappropriate influences;

• Responsive to the needs of the people;

• Effective at delivering results;

• Efficient in making best use of resources; and

• Performance-oriented, improving service delivery by focusing on the needs of the public as customers.

To meet this challenge, the Government will build upon the solid foundations of reform that have already been put in place under PRS. First, the Government will ensure that current and planned reforms are implemented so that their full benefits can be realized. Second, the performance of the current civil service must be managed to increase productivity of the service and reduce incidences of corruption across the public sector. In order to continue to modernize human resource practices, the Government will continue to support the recruitment and development of skilled civil servants and ensure gender equity across the public sector. Finally, the Government will seek to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of autonomous agencies and state-owned enterprises through a rigorous overhaul of their operational frameworks.

Outcomes indicators (by 2017): All ministries, public agencies and SOEs have published their strategies and organizational charts and adopted measurable and transparent indicators of operational performance. All ministries have instituted merit-based recruitment and promotion. Civil service pay scale has been rationalized and is published. All civil service appointments are publically advertised, and appointments and promotions show improved balance in terms of gender, age (youth), disabilities and tribal origin.  

Priority interventions: Political and social leaders are committed to implement significant changes to long- established structures and systems and deeply embedded norms. To this end, the professionalization of the positions of Assistant Ministers to upgraded positions of Heads of Departments and the establishment of the position of Principal Administrative Officer (the highest civil servant in the civil service) in all MACs based on merit will be completed. Finally, the mandates and function reviews of the remaining MACs will also be completed.

The GC, in collaboration with CSA and LIPA, will develop a comprehensive framework to guide the public sector reform process in order to take advantage of complementarities and achieve synergies.

To improve civil service productivity, the Government will continue to raise the bar for performance standards and will build a robust system for managing under-performance. At the same time, a coordinated effort across government and the institutions, including civil society organizations, concerned with the improvement of integrity in the public sector will reduce the likelihood of Liberians encountering petty corruption and bribery. In order to build upon progress already made to remove institutional barriers hindering high performance, continued restructuring and implementation of the review recommendations will remove any persisting duplications in the organization of ministries and agencies and ensure that the entire public sector is as lean and streamlined as possible. Capacity development is required in recruitment, career development, and both formal and in-service training to fit new mandates and defined functions.

Investment in the development of management skills will bring a multiplier effect to capacity building initiatives across the civil service. Full benefit of the human resource management information system developed under PRS will be realized through coordinated effort to ensure its universal application. At the same time, the success of programs such as the Senior Executive Service (SES) and Transfer of Knowledge through Expatriate Nationals (TOKTEN) will be sustained through their integration into the standard civil service.

In autonomous agencies and SOEs, the Government, as sole shareholder, will impose a thorough review of the business processes and financial management of all SOEs. Detailed action plans, including the option of privatization, will set the way forward for each organization and implementation of these plans will be closely monitored.

Modern public finance management (PFM) techniques and controls will be further extended from the MoF to the MACs and particularly to the SOEs, assuring that public resources are managed according to the PFM Law. Overall, the confusion that persists in some areas of the public sector will be replaced by a fresh landscape in which every role, unit and organization will be defined and necessary for the efficient delivery of government services, and where participants are rewarded based on their performance.

11.3 ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE

The Economic Governance sub-pillar addresses four shortcomings found during the implementation of PRS. The effort for public resource allocation to more closely track priorities of the PRS is paying off, but the budget process still needs to be harmonized with the AfT. Second, disagreements on rights to land tenure and land use have risen as a result of local migrations, repatriation following the civil war, and the rapid increase in concessions on traditionally held lands. These must be resolved in order to reduce the potential for conflict (Pillar I) and ensure a secure environment for investments in land improvement (Pillar II). Third, improved economic governance should assure that concession agreements support broader development processes and respect environmental and other regulations. Fourth, corruption (small and large scale) has undermined people's trust in government, diverted resources from their efficient use, and hindered delivery of public services.

The nation's priorities for governance reform address two major themes: integrity in the collection and use of public funds to address the objectives of the PRS, and management of the country's natural resources-minerals, forests and land-for the benefit of all its citizens.37

Public Financial Management

Public finances should efficiently address the priorities of the Agenda for Transformation with a minimum of waste and diversion to other purposes, public or private. Under the first PRS, the Government produced a four-year PFM Reform Strategy and Action Plan (2011), intended to improve budget credibility and ensure consistency between the strategy and services delivered to the public; to improve budget coverage and budget execution; to strengthen revenue mobilization and revenue administration; to enhance transparency and accountability in PFM, including legislative oversight and

37 Chapter 10 discusses an important element of economic governance-the regulatory regime for encouraging private sector development while protecting the public interest.

the GAC; to enhance controls and respect for the PFM legal framework to sanction non-compliance; and to strengthen treasury management to increase efficiency in service delivery, enhance the value of financial resources, and reduce waste. While much progress was made in addressing these issues, there is a need to consolidate and implement the strategies to generate tangible outcomes.

The Liberian people want personal honesty and well-performing agencies in government, in addition to personal accountability and professional integrity within the public service. The capacity of citizens to hold economic and government agents accountable is very weak, and requires strengthening. The stakeholder survey for the PRS evaluation (2011) showed that 55 percent of the respondents felt that the Government needs to do more to address the issue of corruption.

Under the Public Procurement and Concessions Act (PPCA), procurement devolves to MACs. The GSA is responsible for asset management, while the PPCC is responsible for assuring that procurement regulations have been followed. GSA continues to retrospectively catalog assets already acquired, but has yet to establish systems for recording and tracking assets newly procured. Some of these issues were addressed under the PRS, but there is a large unfinished agenda as part of the broader objective for more efficient use of public resources.

Goal: Strengthen public institutions to ensure revenues and government assets are well managed, free from corruption and monitored and increase transparency and accountability of public and private institutions.

Constraints: PFM reform is constrained by lack of clarity in defining rights and responsibilities for public financial management reform; underlying weaknesses in public revenue generation, including deficient systems, accountability mechanisms, and bribery; lack of clarity of mission of MACs; weakness in operational efficiency of MACs and SOEs, especially their operations at sub-national levels; and lack of adaptability of human resources.

Despite the advance of the 2010 Freedom of Information Act, deterrence and prosecution of corruption remain weak. There are concerns about weak processes and systems to manage public revenues, budgeting and expenditure management, procurement practices and granting concessions-combined with ineffective processes for control of corruption and limited oversight and management capacity in government and the private sector. The provisions of the PPCA are not being implemented properly at the regional and county levels, and funds are not being spent in line with the principles of transparency and value for money. Procurement has not improved sufficiently, with poor understanding and enforcement of the PPCA among ministries and agencies. This makes it difficult for the PPCC to undertake its regulatory function and monitor compliance in a meaningful way. While public concern about corruption is high, CSOs are too weak to mobilize this issue as pressure for public and private reform. The systems of justice and regulatory control have also been too weak to take on the corruption problem.

Currently, MACs lack systems and guidance to track assets, resulting in risks of accountability and corruption. The misuse and damage of vehicles pose a particular concern. PPCC continues to be directly involved in the procurement process, responding to "no objection" requests rather than concentrating on its oversight role of training, guiding, and auditing decentralized procurement agencies.

Strategic objectives): Advance PFM and anti-corruption reforms among revenue-generating MACs; to strengthen domestic revenue mobilization and administration by strengthening the department responsible for collection of national revenues, including those due to the State from all revenue generating agencies, public corporations and concessions; to enhance the clarity of missions and operational efficiencies of MACs and SOE at national and sub-national levels, including the efficiency, performance-based incentives of public servants/human resources; to improve procurement through increased compliance. Advance public financial management and anti-corruption reforms and capacities among government and private sector organizations at all levels. To strengthen the effective implementation and coordination of corruption investigation and enforcement by LACC; expand community role and capacities in monitoring public and private corruption with the PPCA; and to improve oversight of PFM at the regional and county levels and by CSOs; improve the decentralized and accountable management of government assets.

Agents and process of change: Achieving more efficient, transparent and accountability public financial management reform and enhanced performance will require the formulation and effective implementation of a PFM action plan and institutional assessment. This should include introduction of improved financial procedures and mechanisms (including audit and financial controls of MACs and SOEs) for both public revenues and expenditures, at central and local levels. This will require determining, approving and implementing the required organizational reforms of the relevant agencies-especially involving the MoF (the Revenue Department, Public Expenditure Department, and also at the county level)-and the possible establishment and strengthening of a Revenue Authority with enhanced skills and know-how of staff. On the demand side, the Government will conduct education campaigns to increase public awareness and encourage CSOs to monitor public expenditures and revenue collection.

The Legislature will improve oversight of budget formulation and implementation, while a strengthened legal system and strengthened GACs will improve the effective implementation and coordination of corruption investigations by LACC and MoJ, including capacity building in forensic accounting to establish probable cause in the pursuit of corruption judgments. The capacity of the Department of Economic Affairs at the MoJ will be built to also support this. Revenue-oriented ministries and agencies as well as SOEs-especially MoF and the National Bureau of Concessions (NBoC)-will gain new understanding about financial management and anti-corruption reform needs, and establish new processes and systems accordingly. The reform needs will then be implemented in coordination with LIPA and other relevant actors to establish joint programs and actions plan to build skills and know-how to implement the required new systems and processes. Through these steps, reforms for good financial management and anti-corruption will be addressed, combined with the implementation of improved M&E mechanisms. The PPCC will develop and carry out monitoring and information sharing activities that will provide understanding of training and other support needs of officials and agencies in public financial management at the county and regional levels. It will develop a communications campaign to raise awareness of the PPCA and motivation for compliance; and will also conduct post procurement audits to ensure compliance. The PPCC, with findings from the audits and communication campaign, will develop an updated policy to ensure enhanced capacities and compliance of ministries and agencies to the PPCA.

The LACC will conduct needs assessment and develop a collaborative roadmap/strategy to strengthen corruption investigation techniques with partners. LACC will use the action plan to enhance the skills of key personnel and agencies to strengthen corruption investigation. This will include support to the MoJ to prosecute LACC cases. LACC will also work with partners to communicate good practices and lessons learned. Education and training of key CSO and community groups will build awareness and motivation for local collective action to hold government and the private sector accountable for corruption.

Given the nature of this strategic and cross-cutting theme, numerous public sector agencies will implement priority interventions to achieve the above objectives and goals. These include MoF, which will provide overall coordination in close collaboration with the MoJ, LACC, NBoC, LIPA, SOEs (FDA, LPRC, RIA), ministries that expend the largest percentage of the national budget (MPW, MoE, MoH), PPCC, the Enforcement and Prosecution Unit of the GAC, and legislative bodies (to enhance budget oversight and accountability). In addition, strategic CSOs will be actively engaged to carry out and coordinate demand-side aspects of anti-corruption interventions.

To address the difficulty of tracking government assets, particularly those in counties, procurement systems, ministerial procurement entities, the GSA and their regulator, PPCC together will establish and carry out enhanced systems and procedures to manage assets, including vehicle loans, throughout Liberia. These actions will contribute to improved service delivery for its citizens. Establishing the correct roles and functions of the PPCC, MACs procurement agencies and GSA will involve providing appropriate training and organizational guidance. PPCC will provide overall coordination, with active collaboration of relevant organizations in regions and counties.

Outcomes indicators (by 2017): Reduced discrepancy between the initial budget and final outcome for revenue and expenditure in all MACs and increased shares of MACs that publish regular and timely audits of accounts and management. Increased compliance with an enhanced PPCA, and an increased domestic revenue mobilization (including payments due from all revenue generating agencies, public corporations and concessions). Published indicators of operational efficiency of MACs and SOEs show improvement. Increased press coverage on public financial management and corruption issues- publishing of the results of corruption investigation by LACC. An increased number and conviction rate of corruption investigations by LACC. An increased percent of lawsuits that address whistle blowing and corruption accusations are increasingly decided in favor of the whistleblower. Surveys show enhanced roles and capacities of CSOs and community groups in monitoring corruption in public and private sectors. The activities will lead to enhanced operational and implemented procedures for improved procurement and management of government assets-particularly vehicles-in place at central and eventually local levels; surveys will report that stakeholders perceive improved delivery of key property procurement and management.

Land Tenure and Use

Land tenure and use continue to impede broad-based growth and social welfare. Conflicts continue and are even increasing under traditional systems that are based on the right to use-but not damage- communal lands both within and between ethnic groups-an effect of mobile populations and shifting cultivation. Conflicts are also arising between land ownership (including use under traditional systems) and western lease-holding contracts as agricultural and mineral concessions are reintroduced with little or no reference to existing land use (see next section). According to recent research, traditional village land disputes have increased greatly, while other forms of conflict have fallen. Finally, the development of local governance and autonomy is limited by ill-defined property, district, and county borders.

Nationwide consultations on the National Vision reveal that the broadly held view among Liberians is that land belongs to the people and that local people should be major stakeholders in all land decisions, particularly regarding the governance of land. Concessions are broadly seen to restrict access to land for

"We think that government needs to tell the people to stop spoiling our farm land by cutting down all the trees. We just see them coming. How they come, we don't know"-Martha Sunshine (participant from: Yarpah Town, Nyorwein district, Rivercess County)

  villagers and thus reduce possibilities for agriculture. Several suggestions ranging from using tribal certificates obtained from the elders as a prerequisite for private land ownership, to restricting the size of property holdings, and developing women and youth land schemes were propounded during the consultations.

The numerous issues around land, both at the national and sub-national levels regarding traditional and tribal claims, concessions for mining and forestry, and environment and habitat protection, underscore the need to thoroughly explore the dynamics of land governance institutions and study in particular how decentralization of land governance could influence relations of governance, the legitimacy of local land tenure institutions, and the resolution of local land conflicts. Obviously, such an exercise is highly political and will require multi-party interaction beyond the scope of the AfT. In the AfT, the lead government M&As are urged to fully engage all stakeholders in developing the appropriate policies to address this extremely important issue.

Goal: To develop a comprehensive national land tenure and land use system that will provide equitable access to land and security of tenure so as to facilitate inclusive sustained growth and development, ensure peace and security, and provide sustainable management of the environment.

Constraints: Analysis and consensus among diverse stakeholders point to three types of land tenure constraints. First, mutually inconsistent land policies: the absence of an up-to-date national land policy has rendered the existing land laws grossly inadequate to cope with the country's development goals and challenges. Current policies on public, communal and private lands have conflicting provisions with the Constitution and other laws that do not reflect current conditions and realities, resulting in land disputes. Second, there is lack of clarity of stakeholder rights and responsibilities. Policies to promote sustainable land use and investment are non-existent or unclear, and the existing regulatory framework for negotiating land investment is weak. Third is administrative complexity, as outmoded systems of land administration and management have resulted in multiple sales of land, encroachment, boundary disputes, and various other land disputes at the national and local levels.

Strategic objectives: Review and regularize existing policies and legislation with the aim of removing those in conflict with the Constitution or with current laws and treaties. Formulate, approve, and carry out enhanced land use policies and strategies that clarify stakeholder rights and responsibilities, and improve sustainable investment in land. Simplify and ease the land administration and management systems.

Agents of change and change process: The Land Commission, in consultation with local and national stakeholders, will improve the policy regime on public, communal and private lands to regularize the conflicting laws and regulations. Mapping and boundary demarcation will permit improved investment security and provide land administration appropriate to Liberia. And the LC will develop collaborative processes for land dispute and information at the community level. Increasing introduction of cadastral data will rationalize databases among the LC, National Bureau of Concessions (NBC), MIA, Ministry of Lands, Mines and Energy (MLME), MoA, FDA, and the registry of tribal certificates.

Outcome indicators (by 2017): Increased proportion of urban and agricultural land will be economically utilized. Reduced conflict over land, between private individuals and with concessionaires, as well as between counties. Reduced average time and steps required to obtain an official record of who has claim to a parcel of land.

Priority interventions: Land Commissions (LC) will develop consistent policies on public, private, and communal land in consultation with stakeholders and consistent with the Constitution and current laws and treaties. The LC will conduct mapping and boundary demarcation that permits investment security. It will provide land administration appropriate to Liberia, including a record management system at the national and local levels common to all LCs responsible for allocating and monitoring property rights, land use and concessions. It will also develop and make functional a collaborative system for land information and dispute resolution at the community level.

Concessions

Liberia is blessed with abundant natural resources that can support broad-based economic development, although many are concentrated by geographic distribution (minerals) or economies of organization (plantation agriculture). The history of Liberia is cause for legitimate concern about the development of these natural resources, and the AfT seeks to avoid the recreation of an enclave economy that brings little benefit to the local population.

Under the first PRS, the Government improved the concessions process, leading to standardized treatment concerning respect for national labor; environmental and other laws; third party access to concession infrastructure; and opportunities for linkages between export-oriented enclave concessions and the rest of the economy. The creation of the National Bureau of Concessions (NBC) enlarges government's authority in the concessions process to provide enhanced negotiation (and due diligence) capability; and to provide monitoring and compliance to assure that concessions meet criteria of a public good, including fairness and the cost-benefit balance. However, it must develop these capacities. Under the second PRS, the legal framework will be simplified, standardized and codified, and non-government stakeholders (particularly affected community groups) will be brought into monitoring; processes will be developed for fiscal, social and environmental reporting on concessions.38

Goal: To improve the negotiation, management and monitoring of concessions to ensure they effectively contribute to broad-based economic and social development. Concessions agreements will be taken in the interest and for the benefit of the people of Liberia, not just the private parties seeking profitable activities.

Constraints: First, there is lack of clarity of stakeholder rights and responsibilities in concessions involving the State. A weak enabling environment for concessions management significantly impairs progress in the economic governance sector. The main challenge is the lack of clear agreement on defined roles and responsibilities of sector MACs and other partners for monitoring and managing concessions. Second, there is a lack of transparency of information to stakeholders on concessions. There are no mechanisms to effectively negotiate or monitor the compliance of concessionaires with concession agreements. In addition, the Government, CSOs and communities are not monitoring the impact of concession agreements. At the negotiation stage, the information available is highly asymmetric, with the concessioner holding a monopoly on data; and there are no local hearings to validate concession terms or ascertain compliance with existing land rights. Further, post-award monitoring for compliance is difficult because the NBC lacks audit skills in non-financial compliance and the ministries responsible (health, education, and environment) have not yet issued standards applicable to concessions and concession-holders. As a result, compliance is haphazard and there are no data showing the extent to which the concessions contribute to broad-based economic and social development. Local residents claim they are denied access to communal and public lands, and that some concessions remain fallow while villages lack

38 Policies to establish linkages between private concessions and public infrastructure in order to leverage the concession investment for public good are discussed in Chapters 10-11.

arable land. Thus, the public has little confidence in the process in terms of fairness, integrity and cost/ benefit of concession agreements.

Strategic objectives: Streamline and clarify concessions policy with legislation that delineates roles and responsibilities of sector ministries; and codify the model concessions agreement accordingly. Use LEITI and other means to improve the transparency of information on concession agreements to ensure public confidence in the process. Strengthen the administrative apparatus of new NBC to perform due diligence, negotiate concessions, and enforce them transparently.

Agents and process of change: Current concessions policy will be reviewed with empowered stakeholders to develop action steps to streamline and renew the policy. The legal framework and roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder will be agreed on to amend the policy, and a memorandum of understanding between ministries and agencies will clarify the allocation of responsibility for carrying out concession management. An up-to-date concessions negotiation and monitoring process will be established with government and non-governmental stakeholders, including local residents. Skills of government staff dedicated to concession management, especially the NBC (newly established in 2012), will be built so they can coordinate and monitor the new process and compliance. New public information sharing, reporting, and feedback processes will also be established to ensure public confidence is built, and community groups and CSOs will participate in monitoring the activities and compliance of concession holders. The legal framework will be simplified, standardized, and codified. Processes will be developed and implemented for fiscal, social, and environmental reporting on concessions; and there will be enhanced policies to establish linkages between private concessions and public infrastructure in order to leverage the concession investment for public good. NBC will play a key role in carrying out and coordinating the above activities, working in close collaboration with diverse community groups and CSOs, especially those located in the concession areas.

Outcome indicators (by 2017): Concession revenues have increased strongly. The terms of all concession agreements, revenues, and compliance status of concession agreements have been made publicly available on a timely basis. Surveys reveal improved public awareness and increased public confidence in the concessions agreements and process.

Priority interventions: An enhanced concessions policy and enabling legislation will be formulated, approved and implemented, and a sound memorandum of understanding between ministries and agencies responsible for carrying out concession management developed and implemented. Model concessions agreement developed under PRS will be codified in all agreements going forward. Community groups and CSOs will be fully engaged in concession monitoring; dedicated NBOC staff will be trained to conduct and manage due diligence process, negotiate concessions and transparently to enforce them. For monitoring, government will publish reports on public perceptions of the transparency of the concession process and on community benefits.

Box 11.0 lists some costed priority interventions in the Governance and Public Institutions Pillar.

Box 11.0: Costed Priority Governance and Public Institutions Sector Interventions

• Organize a national referendum.

• Establish M&E system in the Governance Commission to assess and monitor decentralization and local governance

• Support Capacity Development under decentralization

• National identification biometric scheme

• Priority Public Sector Reform Interventions

11.4 Capacity Development Needs and Opportunities for Enhanced Governance The locally created results framework that underpins the governance pillar presents common capacity challenges at institutional level and to empower local actors from government and non-government. Multi-stakeholder capacity development interventions should be directed to empower local agents of change (covering government, legislative and non-government sectors), including in areas of:

• Demand for accountability, especially from CSOs.

• Transparency of information to stakeholders.

• Ambiguity of stakeholders' rights and responsibilities.

• Operational inefficiencies of organizations and weak service delivery outcomes.

• Financial difficulties and misconduct.

The following transformative capacity development interventions involving the governance pillar will contribute to intermediate outcomes, which will empower local actors to address the above constraints:

• Strengthen strategic networks and coalitions of CSOs to work together with government to promote enhanced transparency and accountability, communication, and public information in addressing many of the above governance-related issues.

Increase awareness, understanding and impart relevant skills and know-how to be more effective in addressing strategic governance-related issues, including: strategies toward decentralization of and enhanced quality of public services; promoting greater national identity; public financial management reforms; civil service reforms; planning, budgeting and monitoring processes; enhanced transparency and anti-corruption actions, including investigative skills and follow-up actions to ensure transparent and consistent enforcement; more transparent and socially beneficial concession agreements and compliance; improved public procurement planning and compliance; enhanced land administration processes.

Surveys reveal improved public awareness and increased public confidence in the concessions agreements and process.

CHAPTER 12. PILLAR V-CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES

While all facets of Liberia's social and economic development are interlinked, eight in particular are cross-cutting and do not belong in any one of the four pillars. Of the eight issues, four refer to particular demographic groups: women and girls (Gender), children (Child Protection), Persons with Disabilities, and Youth (Empowerment). The other four do not refer to any particular segment of the population, but have implications for society's overall productivity and well-being: Environment, Human Rights, Labor and Employment, HIV and AIDS (Table 12.1).39 Conflict Prevention, an issue that also cuts across all pillars is discussed in the Peace, Security and Rule of Law Pillar. Developmental Capacity is discussed as an integral part of the whole growth and development process and thus is already incorporated into all four pillars.

Table 12.1: Goals for Cross-Cutting Issues

Pillar Goal: Mainstreaming Cross Cutting Issues across all sectors for society's overall productivity and well-being, with particular emphasis on the vulnerable segment of the country's population (Women, Children, Persons with Disabilities and Youth) For Specific Population Groups:

A. GENDER EQUALITY: Improve the socio-economic and political status and capacity of women in Liberia.

B. CHILD PROTECTION: Ensure the protection of children's rights; shield them from the effects of vulnerability and discrimination; and provide a safe environment where they can realize their full potential.

C. DISABILITY: Improve access to equitable social, political, and economic opportunities and provide full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for persons with disabilities (PWD)

D. YOUTH EMPOWERMENT: To empower young people as full participants in all aspects of Liberian society.

For all of society:

E. ENVIRONMENT: Improve management of the environment to ensure that it contributes to sustained economic development and growth in all sectors and at all levels.

F. HIV and AIDS: Reduce the spread of HIV and AIDS and mitigate its impact on persons living with HIV and AIDS (PLHIV) and their families.

G. HUMAN RIGHTS: To combat human rights abuses and advance the welfare of all Liberians, irrespective of sex, ethnicity, geographical location, political affiliation and socioeconomic condition.

H. LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT: To promote the sustainable creation of decent jobs for Liberian men, women and youth, including the PWD

As shown in Figure 12.1, the population-specific CCIs entail special poverty problems, as poverty rates are higher among marginalized women, abused and abandoned children, disempowered youth, and the forgotten disabled. Various physical and social barriers exclude these segments of the population from

Liberia's economic and socio-political life, thus compounding their poverty.40 Further, poverty is associated with level of education, with rural dwelling, with agriculture as an occupation, and with age, among other factors. The poverty among these segments of the poor are referred to as "special poverty problems" because, if 300,000 households of able-bodied Liberians are extremely poor, then what can be said about the marginalized, the abused, the disempowered, and the forgotten?

Figure 12.1: Cross-cutting Issues: Special Poverty Problems

The CCIs constitute components of resources needed for growth and development; if they are addressed, they constitute human and material resources to be mobilized for further growth and development, while if ignored, they can undermine the process. Among the shortcomings of Liberia's first PRS was the failure to comprehensively address CCIs. The CCIs did not receive significant attention at the implementation stage, as evidenced in the PRS review, which mentioned only gender and the environment. The Government and its development partners are therefore ensuring that the AfT more comprehensively addresses these issues.

12.1 GENDER EQUALITY

The paradox in Liberia is that women have weaker influence in the marketplace and the political arena, although they constitute the majority of the active labor force in agriculture-particularly in food production-and form extensive networks in the informal sector, where they are noted for their entrepreneurial abilities and creative skills. The culture of patriarchy pervades Liberian society, beginning

in the family with men as heads of households, and serves as the model for organizing society-its economy, politics and socio-cultural life. If the participation of women in society and economy is held back, Liberia as a whole is worse off.

40 See Kollehlon, K.T. "Social Cleavages and Access to Opportunity," working paper presented at the High Level National Economic Forum, 12-13, September, 2011

Wealth creation is a variable sum game; the amount of wealth in a society is not fixed. Not only is the empowerment of the poor in wealth creation not a threat to the wealthy, it leads to more wealth creation, hence an increase in the amount of wealth created.

During the first PRS, the Government, NGOs, community- and faith-based organizations, the private sector, and donors collaborated in efforts to address gender inequalities. Women's participation in the security sector increased; the availability of health care for pregnant women improved; and female school enrollment rates improved, although they are still below those of males. While gender-based crime rates rose between 2009 and 2010, they have since declined.

Goal: Improve the socio-economic and political status and capacity of women in Liberia.

Constraints: Ingrained cultural biases against women and girls are at the root of their marginalization. Women's participation in high offices and in the formal sector, although improving, is still limited. Hence, they face constraints in articulating gender issues at the national level. Some men have a zero-sum mentality, believing that any economic and socio-political gains that accrue to women are a loss to them. Women's ability to fully participate in agriculture and the MSMEs is constrained by their limited access to productive resources such as land for agriculture, start-up credit and professional knowledge. About 60 percent of Liberian small-scale fishers are women, but their effective participation in this sector is constrained by high operating costs and a lack of infrastructure for marketing and preservation.

Strategic Objectives: Improve the capacity of women to respond to gender-based violence and harmful traditional practices. Increase women's participation in the community decision-making process. Strengthen women's participation in income generation and employment opportunities in agriculture, fisheries, MSMEs, and the formal sector.

Priority Interventions (with reference to the main corresponding pillar):

Security and Rule of Law: Review and update existing gender policies, including the security and justice sectors. Include appropriate treatment of gender issues in the training of security and Judiciary personnel.

Economic Transformation: Review and update programs to increase private-sector employment of women in all sectors, particularly in the formal sector and decision-making positions. Review the existing Code of Conduct to provide safe working environments for women. Create programs to ensure that women with entrepreneurial ability have access to start-up capital and credit. Women in agriculture should be assisted in a program to access land, have their title registered, and inherit their husband's land if he dies. Scale-up cash-for-work schemes for women in areas such as waste management and tree planting, and public work schemes such as road construction will be modified to ensure the inclusion of women. Design a program to mainstream both men's and women's concerns in regional trade agreements.

Human Development: Design and implement plans to assist women, particularly pregnant and nursing mothers, to have access to the healthcare they need. Increase the enrollment of female students at all levels of education. In collaboration with women's groups and community leaders, the Government will launch awareness campaigns in schools and mass media on gender issues, such as teenage pregnancy and HIV and AIDS.

Governance: The Government will create mechanisms within MACs to monitor the representation, performance, and welfare of women and girls in all target sectors. Disaggregated national data will be collected on all sectors to reflect issues facing women and girls, men and boys.

Agents and process of change: The MOGD; microfinance firms; rule of law and security sector institutions; community leaders; relevant CSOs (e.g., Farmers 'Associations/Cooperatives); and relevant development partners will work together to design and implement these activities. The Government will draw on the gender mapping analysis done by the African Women's Development Fund. The process of change will involve the participation of women in the public sector through new human rights' policies, the creation of skilled women professionals, increased recruitment of women into positions of decision making, and design and implementation of public awareness programs on the rights of women and girls.

Outcome indicators (by 2017): Increased participation of women in the formal sector, especially in managerial positions, the security sector, and as judges; improvement in the access by women to land, inputs and credit in agriculture and MSMEs; reduced incidence of GBV and increased prosecution rates in cases of GBV; reduced incidence of traditional practices harmful to women and girls; increased girls and women's access to health services and enrollment in schools and colleges; disappearance of gender-bias in school curricula and instructional materials; increased participation of women in community councils.

Box 11.1 list some costed priority interventions in the Gender Sector Interventions.

12.2. CHILD PROTECTION

The inclusion of child protection as a CCI recognizes that children are especially vulnerable to various forms of violence, exploitation, discrimination, abuse, neglect, and other rights violations. Violations of children's rights take place in every country and are under-recognized and under-reported barriers to child survival and development. They are exacerbated in post-conflict environments where official and community-based systems for the prevention of and response to violations have broken down.

Some of the persistent protection issues facing boys and girls in Liberia include exploitative labor practices, harmful traditional practices, general physical abuse, and sexual exploitation, abuse and rape. Certain groups are much more vulnerable than others, including boys and girls living in out-of-home situations (especially those in informal foster settings and institutions); children in contact with the law (including as victims and witnesses of crime, under the supervision of the court, or when

Box 12.0: Costed

Priority Gender Sector Interventions

• Equip and recruit staff in GBV

• Promote women's access to seed production and distribution systems

• Promote women's access to cash crops

• Provide women farmers greater access to extension services

• Training in business skills and financial literacy

• Train health personnel on gender equality and gender sensitive planning, management and budgeting accused of offenses); children with disabilities; and boys and girls living on the street. In addition to the physical dangers they face, children living in these situations are significantly less likely to be enrolled in school; to receive treatment for medical and nutritional problems; or to have access to financial resources necessary to survive. This, in turn, can lead to risky behaviors and negative coping strategies, including transactional sex and criminal activity.

One of the primary drivers behind many of these vulnerabilities and negative outcomes is the common practice of sending children to Monrovia for further education. These children are separated from their families and frequently placed with distant relatives or acquaintances. Despite familial intent for education, these boys and girls are frequently instead exploited in domestic service, hard labor, and other commercial activities. They are also frequent victims of the rights violations mentioned above. Unless- and until-the serious gaps in educational access and quality in outlying counties are rectified, these problems will continue.

In addressing the vulnerabilities and discrimination that children face and designing appropriate child protection responses throughout all pillars, it is essential to not only consider the potential impact of policies on children, but to acknowledge and address the different vulnerabilities and forms of discrimination faced by girls and boys.

Goal: To ensure the protection of children's rights, shield them from the effects of vulnerability and discrimination, and provide a safe environment where they can realize their full potential.

Constraints: In the first PRS, issues of child protection were largely ignored, thus creating gaps in the Government's response and financial commitments to this area. While some progress has been made, particularly in the area of war-affected youth, serious capacity constraints remain within implementing ministries and partners-particularly in the areas of social workers, psychological-social support professions, probation officers and health care workers. Planning in this area is also severely constrained by the inadequacy and unreliability of protection-related data, especially regarding violations of children's rights and children living in out-of-home placements. Organizational constraints include divided mandates among MACs; poor coordination among government, development partners, and civil society protection agencies; and the absence of an independent oversight body.

Strategic objectives: Enhance ownership and adoption of a national policy for children's rights. Enhance monitoring and reporting system for improved policies to properly address children's rights and violations. Enhance technical and managerial skills of child protection practitioners to secure a protective environment for children.

Priority interventions: Implement the new Children's Law (2012) and ensures that its promises are realized, including campaigning for national awareness rising; establishing a National Council for Children's Well-Being; and providing adequate resources to the Child Rights Advancement Fund established under the bill. To improve inter-agency coordination, the Government will develop a national

Child trafficking is a road to modern-day child slavery-the most assured route to the other forms of child abuse-the practice sets the most vulnerable in the society against adults whose duty it is to protect them. As a symptom of greed and moral decay, it is repugnant to the human sense of justice and morality.

system for protecting children's rights, with independent monitoring and reporting. Draft and submit comprehensive legislation addressing national and international adoption and alternative care frameworks for children living away from their parents. Revise labor statutes to comply with international best practices regarding child labor. Establish effective measures and programs to rehabilitate and protect the rights of children in conflict with the law, finding practical alternatives to detention and incarceration. In the area of capacity and awareness, the government will integrate child justice into training programs (both pre-service and in-service phase) of Judiciary, probation, prison and police personnel. This will include standards and codes of conduct for dealing with children in contact with the law; standards for selection and recruitment of staff; and standards of practice for law enforcement, Judiciary, prisons management and staff, lawyers, social workers, paralegals, and other professionals. Develop and institutionalize a social work program to attract and train qualified social workers to deal with protection of children and other vulnerable groups. Create a comprehensive system for monitoring, tracking, and supporting children in informal care settings through the creation of a foster care system and complementary support systems. Implement and sustain nationwide efforts to achieve universal birth registration.

Agents and process of change: The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MoHSW) and relevant ministries, community leaders, CSOs (including religion based), and development partners will act as change agents to promote awareness on progress concerning the rights and welfare of the children of Liberia and domesticate all ratified documents regarding children.

Outcome indicators (by 2017): There will be reduced violation of children's rights, as indicated by reduced incidence of female genital mutilation; reduced rates of under-12 labor force participation; reduced numbers of those under 18 in prison; increased provision and utilization rates of education and health services for children, especially in areas outside Monrovia; reduced under-12 mortality rates; and increased percentage of births formally registered.

Box 11.2 lists some costed priority interventions in the Child Protection Sector

12.3 PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES

Disability is a special concern to Liberia as a post-conflict country. The civil war caused not only deaths, but also impairments such as loss of limbs, loss of sight and trauma. According to a 1997 UNICEF study,

Box 12.1:

Priority Child Protection Sector Interventions

• Create a National Commission on Children's Rights

• Train and increase the capacity of the Liberia National Police for child rights protection

• Build juvenile courts, cells, and rehabilitation centers for children

• Develop a staff of professionals trained in the areas of family law and children protection

• Establish additional fully equipped safe homes and rehabilitations centers, with qualified human resources

16 percent of the population of Liberia was considered disabled before the civil war-of that number, 61 percent physically disabled, 24 percent blind, 7 percent deaf, and 8 percent with mental disabilities. The situation surely worsened with the civil war, but there is lack of current data.

Disability leads to special poverty problems. Persons with disability (PWDs) cannot easily do physical work to help themselves. They suffer from negative public attitudes, and accurate information on them is hard to compile. The PWDs have limited access to basic services, particularly education and healthcare. Due to limited national and community-based funding, PWDs often cannot access public buildings and the information that could help them improves their lives.

Goal: To improve access of PWDs to more equitable opportunities in society and provide full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for PWDs with respect for their inherent dignity.

Constraints: There are cultural biases against PWDs, as well as many physical and logistical barriers to their accessing economic, social, cultural, medical, and educational facilities and opportunities. Existing building and transport infrastructure rarely provides access, and retrofitting will entail costly investment. Even new building codes are not friendly to PWDs. There are few special education instructors and facilities, and no funds exist for occupational training for PWDs. Their views are not reflected in national policies and there is a lack of adequate data on them. Families of PWDs have difficulty improving their life chances and are limited by above-average rates of illiteracy, unemployment and underemployment, and below-average occupational mobility, nutritional status, and immunization coverage. The lack of access to information and resources, and the social marginalization of PWDs, reflect the social, cultural and economic barriers against them.

Strategic objectives: Ensure multi-stakeholder ownership of a coherent and comprehensive national policy and strategies for PWDs. Improve access by PWDs to basic social services and skill development. Protect children and women with disabilities from exploitation, violence and abuse. Improve society's perceptions of PWDs.

Priority interventions: Conduct a comprehensive review of national legislation, including the National Commission on Disabilities Act. Ensure the application of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in the national legal framework. To strengthen government capacity to collect, analyze and disseminate national- and county-level data on the situation of PWDs. A National Accessibility Plan will be established with clear targets, including preferential treatment for access to public places and transportation. Programs will educate the public against being violent and abusive to PWDs, particularly women and girls with disabilities. Develop guidelines to ensure that PWDs have access to enterprise and skills development as well as social services such as healthcare. Assure adequate training on community-based rehabilitation (CBR) strategies and programs of professionals in the social welfare and health system, and the incorporation of persons with disabilities in the CBR teams in rural areas. A National Braille Printing Center will be established. Develop policies and guidelines against the discrimination against pregnant women with disabilities and HIV and AIDS and PWDs in general.

Agents and process of change: The MHSW, in collaboration with other relevant ministries and NCD, CSOs, community leaders, and development partners will implement the above. The NCD, in partnership with the relevant MACs, CSOs and development partners, will design legal, education, health, economic and socio-cultural programs to meet the needs of PWDs.

Outcome indicators (by 2017): Reduced rates of poverty and unemployment among PWDs; Increased access by PWDs to basic services (health, education, job training, and social protection), with necessary adaptation to meet the needs of PWDs (for example, medical practitioners trained to treat PWDs, special education teachers and publications in Braille); Increased share of commercial, medical, educational and public facilities with improved access for PWDs; Inclusion of PWDs categories in national statistics.

Box 12.2 lists some costed priority interventions in the Disability Sector

12.4 YOUTH EMPOWERMENT

Youth is a socially and culturally constructed category that has more to do with socio-economic achievement and behavior than with age. In Liberia, the age of youth is defined as between the ages of 15 and 35, reflecting the great obstacles that young people face when transitioning into adulthood in a complex environment characterized by fragility, underdevelopment, and the legacy of war. With 75 percent of Liberia's 3.5 million below the age of 35, youth encompasses a wide segment of the population. Therefore, addressing the heterogeneous needs and challenges facing youth are fundamental for development.

Liberia's future will be determined by harnessing the energy and creativity of its large youth population and ensuring that they are directed towards reconciliation, sustained peace, and national development. This will require concentrated and holistic attention and investment, addressing the lack of educational opportunities, lack of access to health services-particularly sexual/reproductive and mental health- limited livelihood and job opportunities, and the security risks they face through daily life. While providing for their basic needs is critical, so is creating the conditions for inclusion-allowing youth to be at the forefront of political and civic engagement and integrated into decision making structures and processes in a meaningful way at all levels of society.

If the needs of youth are not met, Liberia will become an even more inequitable society, where those who are able to quickly transition into adulthood will have opportunities, and those who face obstacles will be

Box 12.2: Costed

Priority Disability Sector Interventions

• Recruit and train more sign language interpreters on the health teams at national and local levels.

• Establish rehabilitation clinics.

• Improve existing social services for person with disabilities.

• Provide mechanism for accessible building marginalized for life. Poverty reduction must be infused with peace-building strategies and civic engagement, with youth playing a strong leadership role in the processes of reconciliation and nation building.

Goal: To empower young people as full participants in all aspects of Liberian society.

Constraints: During the civil war, young people were among the most affected as both perpetrators of violence and as survivors. The legacies of this involvement and underlying factors-including limited access to social services (education and health) and employment/livelihood opportunities-that are left in its wake must be addressed to ensure continued peace and stability in Liberia. In the post-violence context, high-risk youth are those who continue to encounter difficulties reintegrating into their communities and securing livelihoods, due to limited skills acquisition and opportunities.

Youth are often considered a homogenous and undifferentiated group. The reality is they are highly heterogeneous with varied needs and reasons for underdeveloped capacities, which limit their contributions to Liberia's progress and development. A continued lack of engagement and lack of opportunities creates frustration and anger among youth; lack of channels and forums for them to voice their concerns and interests leaves them vulnerable to manipulation towards political violence, social unrest, and criminal behavior. Therefore attention to youth education, access to resources, political and civic participation, and addressing the legacy of the war-particularly with regard to disability and mental health-are absolutely fundamental to achieving sustained peace, security, and reconciliation in Liberia.

Particular constraints in this sector include a lack of participation of youth in political decision making, limited availability of information for youth populations, weakness of coordination and delivery of youth-focused activities, and limited operational effectiveness due to a lack of resources. These constraints limit the achievement by youth, as they continue to face obstacles in accessing the labor, education, and social service opportunities that would empower them to become fully active members of the Liberian society.

Strategic objectives: Strengthen the role of youth at national and community levels in decision making, conflict management, and reconciliation. Improve private-sector employment opportunities for youth. Increase youth access to and utilization of health, education, and ICT services.

Priority interventions: Implementation of the National Youth Policy, initiated during the 150 Days, will strengthen coordination, communication and decentralized representation at the county level in order to better engage local communities. Young people are already playing a critical role in peace-building in communities across the country-managing and mediating conflict and becoming specialists in Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). This role will be encouraged, supported and professionalized in order to address the strain and limited capacity of the formal justice system when it comes to resolving civil matters and increasing community social cohesion. Youth are to play a strong role in sociopolitical and individual-community level efforts to increase social cohesion through dialogue and political engagement. Youth-led Peace Committees, advocacy campaigns and civic engagement will be strengthened. "Diversion" programs will be created that keep first-time and nonviolent youth offenders out of the criminal justice and corrections system, with rehabilitation centers established for drug offenders and juvenile delinquents (or special programs to address this need provided through youth centers). Increased opportunities will be made available for both formal and informal education programs including literacy, numeracy, life skills, vocational training, and work readiness preparation. The national and local governments will support Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, re-launched during the 150 Days.

Building capacity of existing youth organizations will ensure that they adopt an inclusive and democratic approach. The management capacity, training expertise and resources available at youth centers across the country will also be developed. Access to business skills training will be provided to young entrepreneurs, while companies will be incentivized to partner with youth for local promotion and sales of branded products following the micro franchise model. Finance institutions will be engaged to increase youth access to loans and microfinance by developing youth-friendly lending criteria. Agricultural training will be paired with land reform, access to markets and business development in order to make the agriculture sector more profitable and thus more appealing to youth.

Agents and process of change: The National Youth Advisor to the President, appointed during the 150 Days, will coordinate the efforts of the Ministry of Youth and Sports (MOYS), MOGD, microfinance firms, youth groups and centers, relevant CSOs (e.g., FLY), community leaders and relevant development partners to act as change agents. In partnership with the relevant ministries and agencies, as well as CSOs and development partners, the MOYS will design legal, education, health, economic and socio-cultural programs to meet the needs for the empowerment of the youth.

Outcome indicators (by 2017): Rates of employment, voting and formal-sector participation by youth increased. Surveys show reduced perceptions and incidence of youth disengagement, disillusionment and psychological difficulties. There is increased youth access and utilization of health and education services. Reduced crime rates among youth.

Box 12.3 lists a major costed priority intervention in the Youth Empowerment Sector.

12.5 THE ENVIRONMENT

The Liberian economy is largely dependent on extractive industries (timber, rubber, minerals, etc) and agriculture. Thus, environment and natural resources clearly underpin Liberia's social and economic development. The environment is the base for mineral wealth and must therefore be effectively managed to ensure sustainable livelihoods and economic development and growth. The linkage of environment, development, and poverty must be appreciated if Liberia is to achieve sustainable development. Unsustainable use of the environment and natural resources can lead to depletion of resources or environmental disaster that may have negative consequences on livelihood sources, especially for the poor.

In Liberia, as elsewhere in Africa, the poor generally depend on natural ecosystems for their livelihoods and live in the most fragile and degraded rural and urban areas. Most of these communities are directly dependent on the use and trade of natural resources for their livelihoods. And yet very little policy support

Box 12.3: Costed

Priority Youth Empowerment Sector Interventions

• Develop and support a youth empowerment program of skill building and job creation exists to enhance these natural resource-based livelihoods. Sustainable development depends largely on successfully integrating the environment into economic planning and decision making. Insufficient understanding of the contribution of environment and natural resources to growth and poverty reduction has led to limited investment in the environmental sector, and thus to environmental degradation that threatens sustained economic growth and livelihoods.

Liberia faces numerous environmental challenges that have the potential to derail the nation's development initiatives and impact its ability to achieve the MDGs. These challenges include tropical rain forest deforestation; soil erosion; loss of biodiversity; coastal erosion and pollution of coastal waters from raw sewage; mangrove draining and reclamation in urban areas; sewage and solid waste disposal and management; and numerous climate change related issues-loss of productive land and infrastructure along the coast and sea intrusion into fresh water supply are increasingly a problem in post-conflict Liberia. It is vital that current sector strategies and plans fully integrate poverty, environment and development linkages. The institutions must also be strengthened through capacity building programs, stronger cross-sectoral coordination mechanisms, and an improved M&E framework.

Goal: To improve management of the environment to ensure it contributes to sustained economic development and growth in all sectors and at all levels.

Constraints: The environment sector is severely hampered by weak environmental governance, including limited compliance and enforcement capacity; lack of national environmental quality standards and relevant regulatory tools; limited implementation of environmental policy due to conflicting roles of governing bodies; low budget support; the weak link of environmental management to Liberia's economic development; weak public awareness and public participation in the promotion of environmental sustainability related to critical environmental issues (particularly climate change, waste management and conservation); poor inter-agency coordination in the areas of effective Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), harmonized sectoral environmental laws and policies, and environmental reporting; uncoordinated land use policy and practice that hinders the sustainability of agriculture and food security; inadequate trained personnel; and lack of requisite logistics and infrastructure, particularly in the area of monitoring and assessment.

Strategic objectives: Develop and implement clear environmental policies and quality standards to guide environmental management, including a National Plan for a Low Carbon and Climate Resilient Economy. Strengthen ownership and capacity of government agencies, the private sector and CSOs to understand and monitor environmental policies and regulations. Strengthen ownership and participation of communities in decentralized natural resource management and decision-making on environmental issues.

Priority interventions: Develop environmental quality standards and regulatory tools. Harmonize environmental laws and policies to ensure improved environmental management; gap analysis of sectoral environmental laws and policies. Undertake scientific and institutional frameworks for environmental management. Establish an environmental court as required by the EPA Act. Create environmental awareness, training and education programs through media, schools, NGOs and print education. Develop a public awareness strategy and embark on a sustained public awareness campaign. Recruit and train a critical mass of professionals in key areas for effective environmental management. Strengthen Environmental Units in all line ministries through training and improved coordination. Develop a system to collect and disseminate environmental information and data; and preparation of the State of the Environment Report and National Environmental Action Plan.

Agents and process of change: EPA, relevant MACs, CSOs, agro-business and mining communities, infrastructure developers, community leaders, and development partners will act as agents of change. The change process will involve a cross-sectoral assessment of the personnel and institutional capacity, quality of baseline data, and the legal framework for environmental management.

Outcome indicators (by 2017): Surveys show improved public understanding and support for environmental issues and policies. Newly collected data on environmental issue shows improvements in key indicators, like forest cover, diversity of flora and fauna and the quality of water, especially in urban areas and near mining activity.

Box 12.4 lists some costed interventions in the Environmental Issues and Policy Sector.

12.6 HIV and AIDS

HIV AND AIDS remains a challenge to Africa and to Liberia's recovery and development. The civil war led to internal displacement of thousands and disrupted delivery of basic health services. It increased the vulnerability of people to all manner of diseases, including HIV and AIDS. Today, about 38,000 Liberians are known to be living with HIV and AIDS. Women and girls are at higher risk of contracting HIV infection, with an HIV rate of 1.8 percent, compared to 1.2 percent among men. The gender difference in HIV rates is stronger in younger age groups, with HIV rates among women aged 15 to 24, three times higher than men in the same group.

There are complex inter-relationships between poverty and HIV/AIDS. While poverty is a source of vulnerability (particularly in urban areas and among women and youth), HIV/AIDS intensifies poverty since it undermines the productive capability of its victims. It diminishes the human capital of a country and puts extra burdens on the national health budget. Due to the high costs of drug therapy, extreme poverty and lack of an adequate national strategy, PLHIV in Liberia have little optimism. Thus, combating HIV/AIDs requires both preventing new infections and reducing the impact on those already infected.

Goal: Reduce the spread of HIV and AIDS and mitigate its impact on persons living with HIV and AIDS and their families.

Box 12.4: Costed Priority Environmental Issues and Policy Sector Interventions • Set-up and enhance function of decentralized environmental county offices • Establish Environmental court • Staff NCCSC Secretariat and counterpart agencies

Constraints: Lack of interest and improper use of condoms; vulnerability of women and girls as a result rape; inadequate and unaffordable basic socioeconomic services among PLHIV and orphans and vulnerable children (OVC); vulnerability of women and girls due to harmful traditional practices such as genital mutilation; lack of adequate information on HIV and AIDS in the education sector; limited resources and skills among caregivers; limited reproductive health facilities to prevent mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT); and low utilization and/or coverage for voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) services in the general population. Further, the presence in Liberia of two types of HIV virus makes two different treatment regimens necessary.

Strategic objectives: Decrease risky behavior by increasing knowledge of HIV and AIDS among traditional, religious and community leaders. Improve society's perceptions and acceptance of PLHIV. Improve the quality and coverage of health treatment, social support, employment and economic opportunities for HIV-affected persons.

Priority interventions: Create a program on information, education and behavior change communications (IEC/BCC) in uncovered areas and strengthen the capacity to implement it in covered areas. Establish and equip HIV and AIDS committees on youth and other group-at-risk in all districts and counties and provide materials and training for peer educators. Establish condom drop-in centers for most-at-risk; youth and drama teams and radio awareness programs will also be developed in these areas. Conduct qualitative surveys on HIV messaging with special emphasis on targeted youth, and sensitize significant individuals (such as traditional and religious leaders and community elders) on HIV/AIDS, using existing community social structures. Train personnel to manage the comprehensive condom programs (CCPs) and provide home-based care to support to PLHIV and OVC; this will include medical treatment, social protection services, and psycho-social counseling. Provide training facilities for income-generating skills to PLHIV and their families. To this end, the Government will conduct assessment needs, particularly of food security, to ascertain the level of vulnerability of PLHIV households. As part of the effort, the Government will expand feeding programs for infants and young children exposed to HIV, and will pay particular attention to the enrollment and education of infected children and sensitize teachers and fellow students on the psychological needs of these children.

Agents and process of change: The MHSW, National Aids Control Program (NACP), CSOs, youth leaders, community leaders, religious groups, community radio stations and development partners will act as agents of change. There are various processes that can lower the incidence of HIV/AIDS and improve the living conditions of PLHIV. For example, government agencies and other stakeholders, such as PLHIV support groups, can form a coalition to plan social welfare strategies and programs for PLHIV, OVC, and their families. These will include awareness-raising through public education, employment generation, social insurance, and education support.

Outcome indicators (by 2017): Infection rates decline for HIV and AIDS. PLHIV are enrolled at all levels of the educational system at rates comparable to other school-going Liberians. Rates of poverty and unemployment among PLHIV decline toward the national averages. Surveys show reduced discrimination and stigma against PLHIV.

Box 12.5 below lists few costed priority interventions in the HIV/AIDS Sector.

12.7 HUMAN RIGHTS

Human rights encompasses the "inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family." These are key words of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights passed at the UN in 1948. Thus, issues of human rights, as now understood both nationally and globally, refer to a broad range of civil, economic and political rights-including freedom of assembly, freedom of thought and expression, and the right to participate in the governance of one's country. These rights, which include the rights to education and health care, the right to work, the right to participate in the cultural life of the community in which one lives and the right to personal security, are indispensable.

Human rights violations in Liberia take many forms, including police abuse, intimidation of detainees, harsh prison conditions, denial of due process, arbitrary arrest and detention, and violence against women and children. Other human rights violations involve traditional practices such as female genital mutilation and trial by ordeal. The intensity of these violations are supported and aggravated by substandard practices such as judicial inefficiency and lengthy pretrial procedures and vices like corruption.

Goal: To combat human rights abuses and advance the welfare of all Liberians, irrespective of gender, ethnicity, geographical location, political affiliation, religion, disability and socioeconomic condition.

Constraints: There is low accountability within the security sector; a culture of impunity within the criminal justice system; weak capacity to monitor abuses and prosecute perpetrators; persistent traditional practices that particularly affect the rights of women and children; discrepancies between statutory and customary laws; and ignorance on the part of victims about their rights.

Strategic objectives: Adopt comprehensive and inclusive policies to protect the human rights of all Liberians. Strengthen accountability and enforcement mechanisms for human rights violations during and since the civil war in order to promote peace and reconciliation and curtail the culture of impunity. Strengthen commitments and awareness of communities and CSOs to advance human rights, particularly for vulnerable groups.

Priority interventions: Review security training manuals, upgrade human rights modules, and review customary laws and to ensure that they conform to the provisions of the national Constitution. Sensitize actors in the criminal justice system (judges, police, prosecutors, defense counsels) on the rights of defendants. Train more judicial and security personnel and increase their employment. Ensure that criminal cases are decided at statutory courts, not traditional courts, and create awareness and sensitize policymakers and community leaders on the effect of discrimination based on gender, age or ethnicity. Review school curricula and sensitize teachers on human rights issues in terms of their instructional and provide micro loans to enable caregivers to provide care and support to OVC

• Provide scholarship and other basic educational support to AIDS Orphans and Vulnerable Children and adolescents

• Provide social protection services to PLHIV and families languages and materials at all levels of the educational system. Initiate nationwide awareness programs that will involve the Palaver Hut Program on the issues of human rights, and review the Truth and Reconciliation Commission recommendations on accountability (Extraordinary Criminal Court, Domestic Criminal Prosecutions. and Economic Crimes Investigation and Prosecution).

Agents and process of change: MoJ, MoGD and relevant MACs, CSOs, community leaders and development partners will act as agents of change. The change process will involve the training and recruitment of personnel for the Judiciary and the sensitization of traditional leaders, the national legislature and stakeholders involved in the creation of a national legal instrument for the fair treatment of all Liberians.

Outcome indicators (by 2017): Reduced incidence of trafficking of women and children. Increased prosecution and penalization of those committing human rights abuses, including trafficking in humans. Decreased backlog of cases pending trial and reduced average time that the accused stay in jail while awaiting trial.

Box 12.6 below lists few costed priority interventions in the Human Rights Sector.

12.8 LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT

The majority of Liberians consider reducing unemployment to be the most important measure to improve their household living standards (CWIQ, 2010). Thus, creating enough jobs for all Liberians to be gainfully employed and work their way out of poverty is one of the Government's top priorities. A great deal has already been achieved. The successful macroeconomic and business environment reforms of the past few years have opened the way for the sustained growth of the Liberian economy, which will enable the private sector to generate more and better employment.

Investments in infrastructure such as energy, roads, and ports have and will continue to support this growth; and support to the development of key sectors such as agriculture and MSMEs has created more jobs in these areas. At the same time, concession agreements that have been negotiated are

Box 12.6: Costed Priority Human Rights Sector Interventions • Sensitization and dialogue with rural communities or traditional leaders; advocacy for harmonization of statutory and customary laws; review customary laws and ensure confirmative with national Constitution • Train, recruit and deploy appropriate security personnel in the entire Country; Review security training manual, upgrade human rights module • Construct specialized schools in 4 counties and provide appropriate materials and assistive devices to children with disabilities

expected to create roughly 100,000 new jobs; direct employment has been provided through schemes such as the Liberian Employment Action Program and the Labor-Intensive Public Works Program; numerous vocational training programs have successfully developed marketable skills in key sectors of the workforce; a National Employment Policy has been developed; and the National Labor Force and Manpower Survey has provided critical information on the current state of labor and employment in Liberia.

To build on these successes and scale up interventions for a significant impact on unemployment, every sector across the government and partner system must now work together. Peace and security must be protected and consolidated in order to provide a stable and safe environment conducive to economic growth. Human development must plan for and provide the skills and capabilities needed by a growing and diversifying economy. Good governance must be in place to support the transparency and meticulous management required for the ongoing transformation of the Liberian economy and for the development of infrastructure that will enable the private sector to create more jobs. Labor and employment are therefore critical cross-cutting elements within this strategy. Each pillar contains objectives and interventions that are specifically targeted to support job creation; this section serves only to highlight the key issues and specify those objectives and interventions that will be followed alongside the activities under each pillar.

Goal: To promote the sustainable creation of decent jobs for Liberian men, women and youth, including the physically challenged.

Constraints: The challenge for labor and employment in Liberia is vast in scale. Unemployment is high and of those with jobs, only a small proportion is employed in the formal sector, with a larger proportion in the insecure informal sector. Rapid population growth will continue to contribute to current high levels of unemployment, while issues such as lack of skills and access to finance will continue to limit opportunities for employment. In tackling these challenges, the approach must be both holistic and flexible to provide both direct formal employment in the short term and support private-sector growth to provide indirect employment over the longer term.

Specific constraints include a lack of stakeholder participation in mechanisms to secure jobs and incomes for workers in both the formal and informal sectors; operational inefficiency resulting in weak policies due to a lack of adequate data and information; a lack of clear mandate and coordination among relevant agencies; and limited access to employment opportunities in the formal sector due to a lack of relevant technical and modern skills.

Strategic objectives: Support an enabling environment for increased private-sector employment at fair wages, especially for women, youth and disabled. Provide short-term unemployment for those in extreme poverty. Ensure that the education and training system prepares the labor force to meet the skill needs of the economy.

Priority interventions: Develop and implement plans to remove bottlenecks to job creation in priority growth sectors (wood manufacturing, garments, fisheries, construction and agriculture). Ensure that all concession agreements include defined targets for employment creation and skills development, and requirements to support local businesses, and monitor delivery to ensure that these targets are met. Focus on MSME development through increased access to finance (including through investigation of mobile-telephone banking). Scale up the Labor-Intensive Public Works Program and build the Community-Driven Development program (CDD), with focus on productive infrastructure. Improve TVET provision through close collaboration with the private sector through PPPs and apprenticeships (ensuring demand-led skills development linked to the needs of employers in the market). Promote workers' rights and compensation. A newly appointed Job Creation Focal Point will drive efforts across sectors, working alongside a new Job Creation Development Partner Group. A National Job Creation Conference will serve to raise the profile of this goal.

Agents and process of change: The MoL and the other relevant MACs, the private sector, and development partners will act as agents of change. In collaboration with the relevant MACs, stakeholders and active public-private sector partnership, the MoL will promote national employment policy and programs to improve the quality of the nation's labor stock and create the needed jobs and absorb them.

Outcome indicators (by 2017): Reduced unemployment rates in Liberia for men and women of all age groups, including those with special needs. An increased share of the labor force will be employed in the formal sector. An increased share of workers will enjoy improved working conditions, including access to health insurance.

12.9 CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT NEEDS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENHANCED CROSS-CUTTING STRATEGIES

The locally created results framework that underpins the cross-cutting pillar presents common capacity constraints and challenges at the institutional level involving both state and non-state actors, involving primarily:

• Weak achievement of outcomes as reflected in below average access to key services and their outcomes by vulnerable groups (such as youth, persons with disabilities), also associated with lagging mainstreaming of CCIs in virtually all key sector policies and programs;

• Pervasive operational inefficiencies in all cross-cutting themes, as shown in poor quality of provision and coordination of services, especially involving gender, youth, environmental, human rights; this, in turn, reflects weak technical, administrative and managerial capacities in addressing specific needs and issues of the CC themes;

• Lack of clarity of stakeholder rights and responsibilities, as reflected in weak institutional coordination, unclear policies and mechanisms to enable effective participation, especially by non-state actors at the national and local levels;

• Weak compatibility of social norms and values, as reflected in harmful traditional practices involving child labor; early/forced marriage, unsafe sexual practices, environmental degradation;

• Limited stakeholder participation in planning and decision making processes, especially involving women, youth, natural resource/environmental management.

Accordingly, the AfT design process has identified priority "transformational" types of interventions aimed at empowering strategic local agents of change (involving private sector, CSOs, government sector) that can help achieve enhanced intermediate outcomes and medium-term goals for each CCI, including:

• Providing relevant training and thematic workshops at national and local levels to enhance the skills and know-how of technical and management staff to better address the wide diversity of CCIs, many of which could benefit neglected vulnerable groups (e.g., needs assessments of various CCIs; women's empowerment programs; home-based care for HIV patients; environmental impact through various means (radio, television, community dialogues) to increase awareness of harmful traditional practices which are harmful to specific population groups (e.g., child labor; early/forced marriage, unsafe sexual practices, environmental/forestry degradation);

• Establishing and strengthening coalitions and networks of CSOs at national and local levels which could work together to address key CCIs (e.g., youth and women empowerment issues; human rights and links to security services; environmental degradation issues, especially in the economic sectors of energy, forestry, mining, agriculture; joint formulation, implementation and monitoring of key CCI policies and supporting programs; public expenditure tracking surveys)

12.10 CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES AND THE STRATEGY PILLARS

While programs on the CCIs can be designed and implemented as freestanding programs, in some cases their goals must be directly aligned with the targets and policy objectives of the relevant pillars.

Figure 12.2 and Table 12.3 below present the individual CCIs and their implications for each of the four pillars. They show the linkages among the CCIs and the pillars of Peace, Security and Rule of Law; Economic Transformation; Human Development; and Governance and Public Institutions.

Figure 12.2: Cross-cutting Issues and the Growth and Development Pillars

PS&RL: Peace, Security and Rule and Law; ET: Economic Transformation; HD: Human Development; and G&PIs: Governance and Public Institutions.

Like their implications for the four pillars discussed above, CCIs have implications for one another, as shown in Figure 12.3. This should be kept in mind for policy design and policy implementation. While all are related, only the most obvious are represented in Figure 12.3. Based on Table 12.1, the intra-CCI implications are discussed for specific population groups and society in general.

12.11 CONCLUSION

Given the multifaceted and polycentric nature of CCIs, policies to address them will be designed as joint programs. They will (a) involve the collaboration of more than one ministry and/or agency; (b) take into account not only the technical knowledge required for their design, but also the understanding of the socio-cultural norms and practices in which they are embedded; (c) take into account the fact that their effective incorporation into the strategy requires adequate developmental capacity at both state and local levels; and (d) be dealt with at two levels of linkages-linkages between the CCIs and the pillars (shown Figure 12.2) and linkages within the CCIs (shown in Figure 12.3).

There are risks and possible constraints in the financing, implementation, and M&E of the CCIs. For example, cultural orientations of the general public can work against attempts to improve gender equality. Also, weak capacity within government and Liberian society as a whole could hinder the implementation and M&E of the cross-cutting programs.

CHAPTER 13. COSTING OF THE AGENDA FOR TRANSFORMATION

13.1 INTRODUCTION

This section describes the costing of the Agenda for Transformation (AfT). More than 600 of the interventions originally contained in the Results Framework were costed. The cumulative five year cost of these interventions is estimated at US$3.2 billion.

As there are numerous interventions under each of the five pillars, this section develops a narrative of the costing of the priority interventions. Since priority investments aim to relax the binding development constraints under each pillar, an examination of their costings provides information about the quality and complexity of constraints and challenges as well as tells a representative story of the costing of all interventions.

13.2 APPROACH, METHODOLOGY, ASSUMPTIONS

The approach used to cost the AfT is the bottom-up approach to Poverty Reduction costing. The Ministry of Planning and Economic Affairs (MPEA) hired a costing team, which hosted more than 30 costing seminars among sector representatives and line ministries and agencies. The team used a simple costing template that integrates baseline statistics, where relevant and available, with disaggregated unit costs.

The Costing Team worked with local vendors to develop a matrix of prices and analyzed procurement data across a random sample of government ministries and agencies to situate the price of government procured goods and services within a price bandwidth, spanning a minimum and a maximum price. Prices for FY 2011/12 are used to determine a constant price series for the AfT costs.

Costed targets were generally provided by representatives of sectors and ministries/agencies. These targets, such as the number of teachers or nurses to be trained over the five year period, are generally taken from sector strategic plans and reflect the relevant baseline statistics. Costing seminars did not focus on baseline statistics but more on the targets to be costed. During these sessions, sector representatives aimed to maximize costed targets. These demands had to be weighed against a highly constrained AfT resource envelop, since the AfT will to a large extent rely on donor funding and some form of borrowing. As all cost demands could not be met, sector representatives were urged to strike for an efficient level of costing that both delivers critical impact while staying within the limits of the resource envelop.

Costing sessions relied heavily on the logic of sequencing, both as a means to control costs and more importantly to address issues of absorptive capacity. Activities that depended on pre-existing conditionality, such as capacity, or infrastructure, were pushed to outer years until such conditionalities are addressed. Each costed intervention was critically analyzed to ensure it passed a sequencing test.

Year one (2012/13) costs are significantly reduced due to the possibility that the effective AfT implementation would happen well in the last quarter of the fiscal year. As a consequence, costing of many first year interventions effectively commences in the second year of the AfT.

Costs are not informed by any robust inflation indexing. Any Inflation adjustment will be undertaken by the macro-fiscal unit at the Ministry of Finance.

Exchange rate issues are not considered because all costs are denominated in United States dollars.

13.3 SUMMARY OF AFT COSTS

Infrastructure-- energy, roads, ports, Information, Communication and Telecommunications (ICT)- takes about 50% of total AfT cost. Growth diagnostics performed on Liberia has identified infrastructure as a binding constraint to Liberia's economic development and transformation. Relaxing constraints in infrastructure is expected to have multiplier impacts across all sectors of the economy, reducing energy and transport costs, catalyzing job creation and generally reducing poverty.

Although human development has not been identified as a binding constraint, investment in the full package of human development - the health and wellbeing of citizens, the quality of their schooling and their access to basic social amenities- is a public sector priority. If the skill structure in the country remains weak due to poor schooling at the primary and secondary levels, many Liberians would not be able to access skilled infrastructure-induced jobs, undermining social returns to infrastructure investment. As such, about 20% of Aft Costs are directed to human development.

While the AfT prioritizes these hard investments, investments in the soft issues -peace-building and national reconciliation, justice sector reform, institutional governance, gender and youth development and adequate protections and support for persons living with disabilities - take up about 14% of AfT costs. As the history of the Liberian conflict emphasizes, soft issues can have a deleterious impact on the hard 0.00 200.00 400.00 600.00 800.00 1000.00 1200.00 1400.00 1600.00 1800.00

developments, not the other way around. Civil conflicts, steeped in socio-political and ethnic divides, lead to the destruction of buildings, bridges and ports and to the maiming and slaughter of highly educated Liberians. Investing in these soft issues, whether through resolving land disputes or ensuring wider and equitable access to justice, must equally be accorded high priority status.

13.4 COSTING OF PRIORITY INTERVENTIONS

Pillar I, Peace Security and the Rule of Law, Priority Costs

National security is key to economic development and transformation, since the necessary investments that spur growth hinge on perceptions of a secure economic and political environment. This realization is even keener in Liberia in light of the fact that national security has largely been the responsibility of the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL), which has had at least 8,000 security personnel stationed in Liberia. Planned and ongoing drawdown by UNMIL has raised the stakes for investment in the security sector.

The costing of security sector interventions was informed by the security sector GAP Analysis, which projects the necessary investments that have to be made in the sector to plug the security gap created by the departure of UNMIL troops.

The cumulative five costs of key security sector investments are as follows. Transitioning the Liberia National Police (LNP) to fulfill responsibilities currently under UNMIL is about US$125.00 million; transitioning the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization (BIN) to take over relevant immigration functions takes up US$35.00 million. LNP costs include the cost to train and equip the police. An additional US$15 million has been programmed to cover salaries for about 4,000 new police officers that would be trained. BIN costs include the salary cost for 1,500 new immigration officers. About US$35 million will be expended to equip the reformed Armed Forces of Liberia, AFL. These costs are in addition to costs incurred to renovate and operate the major army barracks, US$19 million.

Peace and Reconciliation Sector priority interventions include implementation of the Palava Hut Program, US$4.5 million. Key investments in the Judicial Reform and Rule of Law sector include interventions to expand and modernize training facilities, US$1.6 million and to provide regular in-service and pre-service training to magistrates, judges and court staff, US$3.5 million.

Pillar II, Economic Transformation: Priority Costs

Economic transformation depends on the quality and quantity of investments made in the economic pillar, especially investments in critical infrastructure.

Key interventions in the Private Sector Development sector include the cost to provide fixed capital financing to Liberian businesses through a GoL loan guarantee scheme, US$ 25 million. In the Macroeconomic Issues sector, the private sector gets an additional US$11.0 million, which goes to microfinance institutions. It is hoped these investments would spur growth in the Liberian driven private sector, which has been stymied by inadequate access to credit and an inability to leverage gains in the dominant enclave sector, since linkages to that sector have remained non-existent.

In the Agriculture and Food Security sector, the key cost drivers are the cost to train 7,500 farmers in high yielding planting methods (rice, cassava and vegetable crop production) US$6.6 million; establish fertilizer distribution points in each county, US$19 million; and establish service provision centers for power tillers, tractors, seeders, harvesters, threshers, US$61 million.

In the Energy sector, the cost to rehabilitate the Mt. Coffee Hydro dam is put at US$320 million. The cost of about 364 km of 115 kv power transmission lines is put at US$59 million, while that for about 576 km of distribution lines is put at about US$32 million, excluding operations and maintenance.41

In the Roads and Bridges Sector, construction and maintenance of 600 miles of primary roads is US$796 million, with unit cost of a million US$1 million mile of primary road. In the Transport sector, the cost of expanding the Roberts International Airport (Transport Master Plan) and of rehabilitating and expanding existing seaports is projected at $US200 million.

Table 13.2 below table summarizes the cost of priority investments in the economic transformation pillar.

41 Costings for the Energy sector drew heavily from the 2007 World Bank commissioned report "Costing Power Infrastructure

Investment Needs in Africa". Unit transmission and distribution costs were derived by averaging estimates of transmission and distribution costs from nine West African countries used in the study.

Pillar III, Human Development: Priority Costs

Costing of Health Sector interventions was informed by the 10-year strategic plan for healthcare development. The cost of key investments include cost of 19 new health facilities, US$36 million, the salary cost of more than 2,000 new healthcare workers, US$43, million and the procurement of the necessary medical drugs and equipment for the health system, US$60 million. The cost to train specialized healthcare workers, US$9 million: 450 physician assistants (PAs) and Registered Nurses (RNs); 250 certified mid-wives, (CMs); 16 medical doctors sent abroad for specialization; 28 high achieving high school graduates sent abroad to train as medical doctors up to the level of specialization (with binding contracts to work for the GoL for 10 years after training).

In the Education Sector, key investments include the cost of 60 new primary and secondary school facilities, US$41 million; cost to train and develop teachers at all levels of the education system, US$43 million: 5,000 new teachers B certificate teachers, 5,000 in-service teachers, 3,600 Post-Graduate Degree in Education (PGDE) teachers; 500 college students incentivized annually over the next five years to train as teachers.

CHAPTER 14. MACROECONOMIC POLICY FRAMEWORK

14.1 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

The world economy is in a slow recovery from the 2008 financial crisis. Job growth in the US has been low, and economic growth in the European economies has been low or negative. The Eurozone continues to make efforts to reduce Government spending and debt levels, while growth in China has slowed slightly.

The world economy is likely to see a prolonged period of slower growth, with a weak recovery in developed economies and relatively stronger recovery in the emerging economies. This is likely to prompt an effort toward growth-supporting policies.

Commodity prices are unlikely to continue to grow as quickly as they have in recent years, partially because of slow growth in the West and slowing growth in China. This is likely to impact many of the commodity exporting markets, reducing slightly the incomes from those industries.

The international financial crisis has had less impact on African economies, partially because of the separation of the African financial system from that of Europe and America. In 2010, the average growth in Africa was around 4.9 percent, above the world average of 4.2 percent and well above the Eurozone average of 1.9 percent. The African outlook is likely to be impacted by the nature of developments in Libya and the rest of North Africa.

Youth unemployment continues to be a key concern in Africa, and not least because it is a leading cause of unrest in the region. Given the rapidly growing populations of many African countries, the likely demographic conditions will place future pressure on social security systems and labor markets. A flexible labor market will be critical to absorbing new workers, and a competent education system will need to provide young workers with the skills they require. The number of Africans between ages 15 and 24 is expected to double by 2045; and the number of working-age people is expected to continue to rise, according to the African Economic Outlook.

Overall growth in Africa will strengthen as the North African economies begin to grow at faster rates, with growth in many already back to pre-crisis levels. The continent is also expected to move to diversify exports-largely commodities, to react to fluctuations in international prices-and more second-stage processing and tourism should occur in the future.

14.2 AFRICAN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

Economic growth in Africa has been reasonable-in fact, between 2001 and 2010, six of the world's 10 fastest-growing economies were in Sub-Saharan Africa. Growth in Africa averaged 4.9 percent in 2010 (although this did decrease to 3.4 percent in 2011). The economies of Africa have some of the youngest populations in the world and a rapidly growing working age population, making job growth a key concern for all African economies. These economies, however, remain dependent on commodity exports, making them vulnerable to international price movements.

Reductions in European budgets to meet new fiscal deficit targets are likely to constrain the money available for international development efforts and development organizations. This will reduce developing countries' access to less expensive project financing and slow down capital investment funding from external sources.

14.3 LIBERIAN ECONOMIC OVERVIEW

The Liberian economy has been estimated at about US$1.1 billion in 2008 and around US$1.7 billion in 2012; this level of growth reflects the impact that Government policies have had even a short period- rebuilding of road networks have allowed businesses to access markets and suppliers; rebuilding of telecommunications and electrical infrastructure have allowed job creation and improved standards of living; and the restarting of Government operations and automated systems has improved Government effectiveness and increased the ease with which people interact with Government.

In the past, the Liberian economy has been largely concessions based, with rubber and iron ore providing much of the foreign currency. Today, these operations have restarted, and the country is preparing to move away from a purely extractive economy, which has led to inequality and unfairness in the past. Liberians will instead build an economy where the benefits of natural resources are shared, and where a focus on education will be the means of promoting better incomes and lives.

Policy Environment in Liberia Fiscal Policy

This Government will maintain a policy of working with donors and encouraging more donors to bring money into the Government budget as grants. The Government also recognizes that donor financing may not be sufficient to fund new infrastructure projects, and will solicit private sector involvement in Government projects. The Government also expects additional revenue from the enclave sector in the future, as more infrastructure is built and more exports are possible.

Assuming that tax revenue grows in line with the economy, and grant and non-tax revenues remain more or less consistent, the Government expects to see a revenue profile that will meet most of its investment aims as long as the growth of recurrent spending is controlled. The FY 2011/12 budget contains a large amount of contingent revenue, which to date (as of the second quarter) has seen a successful rate of outturn. The Government will continue to tie uncertain revenue to specific projects in a budget annex and fund its first priorities (infrastructure and energy projects) through borrowing. Recurrent needs can be funded by stable sources of revenue, ensuring that MACs have the funding they need to operate, while also saving through efficiency measures.

Monetary Policy

The Government's monetary policy will continue to be one of price stabilization and attempts to promote access to the banking sector. The CBL will use exchange rates as the primary indicator of monetary conditions, and ensure that price stability is maintained through exchange rate stability. Maintaining the value of the Liberian dollar ensures that those who are paid in Liberian dollars do not suffer from a slowly diminishing real income, which would happen if the value of the Liberian dollar decreases relative to the price of goods purchased on the international markets.

The Government will ensure that money supply growth remains stable and that it maintains sufficient international reserves to ensure against major trade shocks. The goal is to maintain the level of CPI inflation at around 5 percent and maintain Liberia's performance in the West African Monetary Zone convergence criteria (on inflation, deficits, reserves, and other measures affecting monetary stability).

Trends in Macroeconomic Indicators

The Liberian economy has seen a strong recovery from the declines of the 1990s and early 2000s, with one of the stronger growth rates in the world. This growth has been made possible by the creation of a stable macroeconomic environment; streamlining of business registration processes; signing of concession contracts; and efforts in each sector to ensure training, capital investment, and the promotion of greater economic activity. The Liberian Government committed during the PRS period to ensure that investment levels remain high; and to undertake efforts to increase Government investment (fiscal rules on investment levels, controlling recurrent spending and allowing MACs to bid for investment projects) and increase private investment.

Table 14.1 outlines the overall economic activity expected during the first MTEF and the PRS period.

Table 14.1: Overall Economic Activity Expected During the First MTEF and the AfT Period

GDP Growth and Levels

An average fiscal year real GDP growth rate of around 6.6 percent is anticipated during the AfT period. However, the Government will target a rate of 1.7 percent higher in order to achieve middle income by 2030. The level of investment anticipated with the current growth rate is around US$600 million per year; and achieving the targeted growth rate would require around US$150 million additional investment per year. This is easily achievable through both the additional investment likely under the PRS; the current expansion of Government investment; and the likely promotion of private investment as a result of the expansion of road and power networks.

Exports 435.0 681.0 883.8 1071.8 1288.2 1495.5

Some of the larger impact is likely to come in the latter years of the AfT because (a) borrowing is being phased in; and (b) the impact of large projects such as WAPP, Mount Coffee, and road expansion will take some time be realized.

Macroeconomic assumptions:

• Continued expansion of concession activity, including the commencement of forestry activity during the PRS period.

• Expansion in the level of home-grown food stuffs, reducing reliance on imports from international markets.

• Expansion in electricity generation with the start-up of a Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) plant; however, Mount Coffee is not included in the current assumption, so there is additional scope for growth once electricity costs fall.

• Estimates for oil extraction are not included, since it is difficult to estimate a likely impact or timeline.

Inflation and Money

The expected inflation rates are set out in Table 13.2; in the long run, these are expected to moderate to around 5 percent.

Table 14.2: Expected Inflation Rates

2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 2015/16

CPI Inflation 5.9% 7.7% 5.4% 5.8% 5.5% 5.2%

GDP Deflator 5.5% 9.3% 0.5% -0.3% 0.5% -0.7%

The inflation rate is largely driven by changes in the cost of international food and fuel prices; this increases the likelihood of shocks to inflation and sudden changes in the rates. In part because of an increase in local production, the inflation rate and sensitivity to international price movements has moderated. However, it is still an area that the Government intends to improve upon.

Fuel prices influence the cost of electricity and transport, which in turn influences the cost of most economic activities. Food prices influence all people, and make up a large component of the consumption basket as well as influencing wage decisions.

Money supply is expected to grow at above 10 percent over the next few years (this is an aggregation of LD and USD money supply). The larger aggregates of money supply are also expected to grow-at around 15 percent over the next few years. It is assumed that larger aggregates will grow at a fast rate as access to the banking sector expands.

Trade and Balance of Payments

We expect in the longer term to see an expansion of exports as the Greenville Port becomes operational and allows increased exports of timber. The increased amount of iron ore exports through the Buchannan port will contribute to the overall rise in exports.

Table 14.3 below shows the values of export and imports forecast over the PRS period; the value of imports are expected to slowly increase in the immediate future in line with past performance; however, they will eventually increase at a slower rate than exports.

Imports 1129.0 1617.0 1565.0 1848.8

Exports 435.0 681.0 883.8 1071.8

The value of net exports is shown in the chart below; the large increase in exports is assumed to align with further concession activity and forestry exports, beginning with the completion of the Greenville Port dredging. The increase in imports reflects the ongoing high level of development partners' activity in Liberia.

The values for remittances are taken from IMF and CBL datasets; the import and export values are IMF estimates. Portfolio investment is assumed to be zero, and FDI is assumed to increase as more concessions begin to increase activity. Current transfers include remittances and the money transferred to fund UNMIL operations; the latter is expected to decrease with the UNMIL drawdown.

14.4 SOURCES OF GROWTH IN LIBERIA

The Government recognizes the importance of moving from the traditional sources of growth- concessions and exporting natural resources-and toward using the income generated from concessions to promote domestic industry and business in Liberia.

Agriculture and Fisheries

This sector makes up a large contribution to Liberian GDP, as would be expected, and employs the majority of the Liberian workforce, particularly in growing staples of cassava and rice. The Government has worked with partners to promote increased efficiency in the food production sector by rebuilding infrastructure and signing agreements with large producers African Development Aid and Libyan African Portfolio (ADA/LAP) to bring new technologies and processes to rice production and other interventions. These include:

• Collaboration between the MoA, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, and the African Development Bank on a US$24 million project to rehabilitate feeder roads and agricultural infrastructure, and cultivate 1,600 hectares of swamp rice.

• Decentralizing the MoA and opening offices in the counties.

• Inland fishing development efforts.

• Smallholder training in rubber culture techniques and training for tree-crop farmers.

Recognizing that the key to poverty reduction is increasing the ability of Liberians to grow food domestically, the Government has invested in ensuring that farmers have the training and capital necessary to do so. A likely source of additional sector growth is the transition from upland to lowland rain-fed rice farming, which typically increases yields. Roughly 5 percent growth is forecast in this sector under normal circumstances, given a typical rate of growth in yield and land dedicated to farming. Access to credit is another area where the Government is intervening to ensure that smallholder farmers have capital for farming.

Forestry

One of Liberia's most abundant resources is its forest, covering 4.3 million hectares or 45 percent of the country.42. This sector has seen strong growth in recent years, and the Government intends to invest in preparing ports and road infrastructure to facilitate further expansions of the sector. The Government has set aside resources for the rehabilitation of the Greenville Port and connecting roads in the FY 2011- 12 budget. This will likely mean that this sector will see strong growth over the next few years before eventually settling to a growth rate of around 5 percent. The Government is undertaking, along with partners, a number of efforts to improve forestry governance and forestry management and monitoring.

Mining and Panning

The Government recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Government of Brazil to cooperate in energy and mining, among other areas. In recent years, this sector has played an extremely small role in the economy, despite the existence of multiple concessions for iron ore (Mittal), gold (Hummingbird), and others. Given Liberia's enormous wealth of natural resources, once these companies become fully operational, this sector will become a larger component of the economy,

42 Forestry Development Authority, 2006: National Forestry Policy and Implementation Strategy generating significant export and government revenues. The Government has plans to undertake national geological mapping to determine the full size of these resources and combat illegal mining.

Manufacturing

Recognizing that the manufacturing sector has not seen the levels of growth evident in other sectors-and the importance of building this secondary industry in order to add value to Liberia's natural resources and support local incomes-the Government has worked to meet the requirements of the Africa Growth and Opportunities Act (AGOA) textile treaty with the US. Improved infrastructure could support the growth of secondary industries that provide better access to external markets. In this vein, the Government recently signed an agreement with the World Bank for the construction of a 249-kilometer road between Red Light and the Guinea Border estimated US$249 million. The Government also has a number of other efforts underway to improve opportunities for manufacturers in Liberia, including:

• Allocating twenty-five percent of government goods and services expenditure and furniture expenditure to local producers.

• The Government is funding two SEZs in Montserrado and Grand Bassa, which should help attract new manufacturers to Liberia.

• The Government is funding warehouses and showrooms for furniture manufacturers, to allow them to showcase and store work and develop larger-scale manufacturing.

Services

The service sector has seen robust growth and remained fairly consistent in producing around a third of GDP. Within the broad service sector, it is estimated that public service provision, transport and trade, and hotels comprise the largest contributions. Each of these sub-sectors saw an estimated annual growth in 2010 of around 5 percent. In the banking sector, the Government continues to oversee the expansion of banking facilities. Once the new Ecobank and First International Bank of Liberia branches are opened in Grand Kru and Sinoe, 11 of the 15 counties will have access to banking facilities. Banks' capital adequacy ratios remain above the minimum required.

• The Government plans to construct a strip mall to modernize shopping facilities and provide a security environment for retailers.

• The Government intends to work to promote business linkages and allow businesses access to the information they need to gain the services they require.

14.5 POTENTIAL RISKS Price

A price shock could involve a change in the price of major imports, a price change in goods produced in Liberia, or changes in the prices of primary materials for production. It could also involve a price change for exports:

• Potential increases in the cost of everyday consumer items, especially rice, would cause a large rise in inflation. This would additionally provide fiscal risk: no additional income (the rice levy is waived), but a potential requirement for subsidy.

• An increase in fuel prices would cause general increases in the cost of production and, because of the wider requirement for fuel for all electricity costs, this could feed through into higher costs and lower output throughout the economy.

Export

This section outlines risks that impact exports or the export sector, which include physical risks not related to price or production:

• An extended time needed to rehabilitate Greenville Port and roads could lead to lower forestry exports.

• A drop in iron ore prices on the international market or fewer shipments due to transportation concerns could lead to lower exports.

Production

This section outlines risks that impact production, including physical risks and risks to the price or availability of imports. These include:

• Downturn in iron ore production.

• Downturn in agriculture production due to lower productivity improvements or lower amounts of land available for expansion.

Impact of Different Shocks

The Government recognizes the importance of ensuring economic stability and a consistent, predictable macro environment for business investment. The key risks set out above also provide an opportunity to establish monitoring indicators and contingency plans. The indicators will be monitored monthly.

14.6 GOVERNMENT FINANCES

Table 14.5 below shows the overall estimated revenue over time. The borrowing level shown reflects the borrowing that is feasible under a sustainable debt path; the borrowing level in the MTEF budget (2012/13) reflects the level of borrowing that is desired in order to achieve all the project investment aims. Additional sources of financing and support (for example, donors) will have to be found to meet these intended investments and any other investments required for the PRS.

Revenue has grown consistently throughout the current Government's tenure; the budget has risen from US$80 million in 2006 US$516 million in the 2011/12 budget. This increase of 5.45 times is a result of widening the tax base, finding new sources of revenue, and strong economic growth. When the current Government first took office, the tax base comprised few sources of revenue and now it has multiple sources-including increased grants, increased contribution of concessions to Government, and a strengthened domestic tax base.

Donor support has increased through grants revenue-from US$1 million annually to US$40.3 million in 2010/11 and US$39 million budgeted for 2011/12. This is a testament to the Government's success in convincing donors of Liberia's ability to spend money on Government services. Further increases in budget support are expected over time. Non-tax revenue, by its nature, has been more variable. But as the Government has negotiated more concession contracts and increased revenue from fees and registrations, these have increased as well. Tax revenue has consistently grown-usually above the general growth of the economy-the result of the increased formalization of economic activity.

The Government also recognizes the importance of investment at this stage in development and is committed to ensuring that it borrows to invest in key projects that are deemed beneficial for the economy. This Government has maintained a cash-based balanced budget under the terms of the HIPC agreement and is now able to borrow again. It intends to do so with due respect for the importance of sustainable finance.

14.7 GOVERNMENT BORROWING AND FISCAL RULES

While setting out policies intended to foster development in the country, the Government also sets out fiscal rules each year in the Budget Framework Paper in order to guide the country's spending, debt acquisition, and fiscal activity. In the first MTEF period, these rules included:

Rules Guiding Borrowing

• All borrowing must be undertaken for the purposes of investment, consistent with the Public Sector Investment Plan (PSIP).

• Total debt stock must not exceed 60 percent of previous calendar year's GDP, as required by the PFM regulations.

• Prior to new borrowing being undertaken, a Debt Sustainability Analysis must be carried out and presented to the Debt Management Committee to ensure that debt rules are not breached.

Rules Guiding Spending

• Twenty-five percent of the budget should be capital spending-of which a minimum of 10 percent should be expenditure on the energy sector.

• No more than 34 percent of the budget will be for personnel costs.

• At least 25 percent of Government spending will be on goods and services provided by Liberian businesses.

• At least 25 percent of Government spending on furniture should be from capable local manufacturers.

• Transfers from investment to recurrent spending: no more than 5 percent of MACs investment appropriations in a given year will be transferred to recurrent spending.

• No more than 15 percent of capital projects should be spent on administrative costs.

• Contingent revenue will be placed in an annex and aligned with specific projects.

CHAPTER 15. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

Chapters 8-11, detailing each pillar, provide strategic and implementation plans for each sector, typically led by the MACs corresponding to that sector. This chapter describes the plan for overall AfT implementation and coordination across sectors, and outlines the role of the major actors in the implementation framework. Given the immense interest expressed by diverse stakeholders during the participatory phase of the process, implementation and coordination design will be flexible to accommodate the diversity of institutions at various levels (national, county, and district) in implementing the AfT.

Low capacity of public and private institutions was identified as a binding constraint to the effective and timely implementation of the Lift Liberia PRS. Several strategic interventions were undertaken and are ongoing in order to address the acute capacity challenges. These include the Transfer of Knowledge through Expatriate Nationals (TOKTEN)43 program, Senior Executive Service (SES) program, and scholarships for tertiary degrees. Civil service reform efforts, with adjustment to pay structures and other incentives, will also help to alleviate the capacity problem. A National Capacity Development Program will be rolled out in the AfT to comprehensively build capacity. This is particularly significant in light of plans to implement the decentralization policy and the need to strengthen the planning, budgetary, and implementation capacities of counties and districts.

15.1 ORGANIZATIONS LEADING AFT IMPLEMENTATION

The implementation of interventions in each sector will be the responsibility of the various MACs. The coordination and M&E of implementation of the AfT at the national level will be led by the Liberia Development Alliance (LDA) Steering Committee and Secretariat.

A. The LDA Steering Committee is chaired by the President and comprises cabinet ministers, the LDA National Coordinator, key donor partners and representatives of key private sector and civil society groups that are part of the LDA. The steering committee will meet every quarter. At the start of each fiscal year, the committee will review and approve (with amendments as necessary) the deliverable plans submitted by the MACs, as described below. At each of the quarterly meetings, it will review the progress reported by MACs in implementing the plans, as described below, utilizing the monitoring indicators as a key input.

B. The LDA Secretariat will be situated within MoF and eventually a proposed Planning Department of the merged Ministry of Finance and Planning. The LDA Secretariat is headed by the National Coordinator of LDA and includes pillar teams, headed by the pillar technical advisors, who convene regular multi-stakeholder Sector Working Groups (SWG) under each pillar. The Secretariat will collect the annually updated implementation plans from all the MACs and check that they are consistent with the AfT and with the three-year MTEF, as revised each fiscal year. It will collect the quarterly implementation reports from MACs and check the consistency of the evidence for progress. The LDA Secretariat will prepare summary reports of this information to submit to the LDA steering committee meetings, highlighting where there are delays or other constraints that merit management attention and capacity development.

43 The Liberia TOKTEN project is being implemented under special arrangement with the UNDP. The objective is

to repatriate Liberian nationals to support nation building through the revitalization of government institutions (http://www.csa.gov.lr)

C. Linkage with the Aid Coordination Framework and Arrangements: The Government is concluding a National Aid Policy that will include enhanced arrangements for Government's leadership in development partner coordination, in line with the principles of the Paris Declaration, the Accra Agenda for Action, and the New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States.

15.2 THE NEW DEAL FOR ENGAGEMENT IN FRAGILE STATES

Liberia's Vision 2030 and the AfT are aligned with the principles of the New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States, a framework for international support for conflict affected and fragile states endorsed at the Fourth High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in November 2011. The New Deal articulates a set of peace-building and state-building goals (PSGs) to serve as the foundation to achieve the MDGs and lay the foundations for sustained development and wealth creation in fragile contexts. The five goals include (a) legitimate politics, (b) security, (b) justice, (d) economic foundations, and (e) revenue and services.

To date, 35 countries and six international agencies have endorsed the New Deal. Liberia was a key participant in the creation of the New Deal and is a pilot country for its implementation. The key donors active in Liberia are fully committed to supporting the New Deal and enabling its focus on genuine country leadership and ownership.

Recognizing that Liberia's road from recovery to inclusive growth and wealth creation is dependent on maintaining peace and building state functions, the AfT's four pillars are strongly aligned with the five PSGs.

To achieve the PSGs, the parties to the New Deal have committed to FOCUS on new ways of engaging with fragile states and building mutual TRUST by providing aid and managing resources more effectively.

Liberia's Vision 2030 and AfT constitutes its New Deal one vision, one plan (FOCUS principle) and articulates the priorities to which development partners should target their support. Over the coming years, Liberia and its development partners will use the New Deal framework to integrate various national planning processes and undertake reforms to improve the effectiveness of aid, as well as prioritize the peace-building and state-building goals to achieve better and more sustainable development results for Liberia.

15.3 INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR IMPLEMENTING THE AFT Interventions and Time-bound Outcomes and Deliverables

In order for the AfT to achieve outcomes prescribed within each pillar-which will be monitored and evaluated according to procedures described in Chapter 15-it is essential for MACs to implement the interventions of the AfT in a systematic, effective and timely fashion.

It is useful to distinguish several categories of interventions:

• Projects in the 2012-15 MTEF are essentially part of the public investment program.

• Projects to be undertaken in 2015-17 involve future MTEFs. These will be incorporated into the planning and implementation process in the later years, but it is important to identify their transformative design features and bring them online as the AfT program unfolds.

• Projects to be funded by development partners. During the AfT, an increasing proportion of the funding from development partners will be channeled through the budget and MTEF, but there will still be some projects directly funded and implemented by development partners (especially involving grants).

• Some interventions are reforms to policy and the regulatory regime that do not require investment budget allocation (or just a modest amount, such as for capacity development), since the implementation of these actions is the part of the regular activity of MACs and should be covered in their recurrent budget.

• Measures to be funded and carried out by private sector and CSOs. Liberian actors-including public-private-CSO partnerships-will undertake some actions in the AfT and increasing their contributions and effectiveness will be critical for achieving the goals.

MDAs will produce and update (every 12 months) their deliverable plans. Deliverable plans are a rolling series of 180-day (6-month) commitments for delivering steps in the priority interventions, as outlined within each pillar. Plans will cover a two-year period-through the current and next budget period in the MTEF. The LRDC Secretariat team will review these plans for consistency with the AfT as well as proper coordination with other MACs' plans. Infrastructure plans, for instance, are critical to support the objectives of other MACs and the private sector. Infrastructure plans also need to be coordinated across sectors (e.g., road improvement projects are done after, not before, water and sanitation projects that tear up roads; rural roads will be rehabilitated in areas where there are agricultural value chain programs).

Implementation Reporting

MACs will report every quarter-at a minimum-to the LDA Secretariat on progress in delivering the planned interventions. Preparing these reports first informs the management teams of MACs so they are aware of the teams' achievements. Each quarter, the LDA Secretariat will collate the reports for presentation, with a summary to the LDA Steering Committee. Then, the implementation reports will be made public so that the public can decide how to participate.

In the annual budget discussions and updates of the MTEF, and in determining the allocation of the public investment budget, the Cabinet (the core of the LDA Steering Committee) will consider the success rate of each MAC in meeting its commitments for deliverables. As elaborated in Chapter 15, the LDA Steering Committee will also consider the evidence for how well the outcome objectives and targets of the sector are being achieved. If the outcomes are poor and the promised interventions are not being delivered, then appropriate measures can be taken to bring in management that will carry out the program. If the planned interventions are being delivered, but the desired outcome results are not being achieved, then the investment budgets of the corresponding MACs might be refocused and, if necessary, cut or otherwise reallocated.

Overall, the system for identifying and reporting on specific and time-bound deliverables-a successful feature of the PRS 1-will continue as an important complement to the M&E process.

Capacity Development for Enhanced Implementation

Effective and timely implementation by diverse stakeholders-state and non-state change agents at various levels-will be enhanced through well-designed capacity development interventions. These are highlighted in the results framework of AfT and summarized in each of the pillar chapters. The updated MTEF and annual work plan and budget of each MAC should include updated capacity development activities, which should also be complemented by the detailed implementation plan of the National Capacity Development Plan.

CHAPTER 16. MONITORING AND EVALUATION STRATEGY

This chapter provides an overview of the main components of the M&E strategy to track and assess the AfT at various levels: short-term progress toward strategic outputs and value for money as well as strong linkages with the budgetary process; medium-term progress toward measureable priority outcomes and goals (by the end of 2017, while also considering key milestones); and emerging longer-term impacts toward the Lift Liberia 2030 Vision. These different levels of the results-focused approach of the AfT constitute critical elements for facilitating evidenced-based, transparent, and participatory decision-making processes. Annexes 1 and 2 provide the results framework and the monitoring plan for each pillar and component sectors, with key measureable outcome indicators. Further details and an operational roadmap will be provided in an M&E plan with related capacity development interventions. The finalized M&E plan will help to ensure a functional system involving key actors at various levels, in line with the strategy outlined below.

First, it is useful to ensure a common understanding of key M&E concepts, as summarized below.

• Monitoring: a continuous process of systematic data collection to inform managers and key stakeholders on progress in relation to planned inputs, activities and outputs, as well as the use of allocated resources. Monitoring is structured around measureable indicators, which assess performance at the input, intervention/output or outcome levels. Indicator targets provide the benchmarks against which progress is monitored. The M&E plan highlights the different levels of indicators required for an integrated framework, namely: (a) Output and outcome monitoring- tracking whether results are occurring in relation to goals and strategic objectives among the target population. (b) Non-financial performance monitoring-tracking performance in relation to interventions and projects that are location specific. (c) Financial implementation monitoring- addressing whether budgets have been released and spent according to approved allocations.

• Evaluation: an independent assessment of a policy, program or project and its contribution to the intended goals and objectives. Evaluations determine the relevance, impact, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability of interventions and the contributions of implementing bodies. Evaluations should feed into management and decision-making processes and make essential contributions to managing for results. There are different types of evaluations, such as impact evaluations, value for money audits, and public expenditure reviews.

• Control: includes internal and external processes, such as financial, procurement, management and organizational audits consistent with the Public Financial Management Act of 2009 and its supporting regulations. Control mechanisms and processes are intended to facilitate achievement of the strategic outputs and outcomes.

16.1 PRS I M&E EXPERIENCE: KEY CHALLENGES AND LESSONS

The evaluation of PRS 1 highlighted a number of key challenges and lessons involving M&E design. These challenges constrained the capacity of the M&E system for PRS 1 and undermined the successful implementation of an integrated national M&E strategy. The identified capacity constraints still remain, and include the following:

• There was an absence of an integrated and locally derived M&E strategy and operational plan; and there were unclear institutional arrangements and roles at various levels. Weaknesses included the lack of sufficient linkages with MACs M&E systems/units to ensure a unified and functional national M&E system, and inadequate human resources and poor incentives for achieving effective M&E results.

• There was a weak statistical database and system, and relatively little attention to addressing these foundational constraints until the latter stages of PRS 1. Existing weaknesses contributing to the inadequacy of the comprehensive statistical systems required to support the AfT results-focused requirements included: 44

- A lack of harmonized statistical methods, standards and classifications within the system, due in part to the absence of the appropriate legal and institutional framework to promote collaboration and coordination across sectors.

- Separate mandates for data collection activities and statistical production, which undermine the incentive to coordinate for an integrated system.

- The inadequate infrastructure and resources in key line ministries, which compromise the quality and scope of statistical production, analysis, and dissemination.

- Inadequate office and storage space with weak logistics arrangements, and deficient technological infrastructure (e.g., Internet connectivity, computers, statistical software and packages, data archiving, storage and retrieval facility).

- Poor working conditions, which make it difficult to attract and retain qualified, experienced professional and technical staff.

• There was an overemphasis on tracking inputs and outputs, stemming from the need to provide key infrastructure and services to a nation recovering from a protracted conflict. The PRS I tracking system of key indicators was mostly output focused, with little effort to develop a more strategic outcome focus. This was due primarily to the absence of a comprehensive results framework to underpin the design of PRS I.

• The M&E demands and requirements came primarily from the LRDC steering committee that met infrequently and from donors, with little demands from CSOs and private sector. This dynamic exhibited weak linkages to a results-focused agenda and to the annual budgetary process. Accordingly, there is a need to broaden the demand for and users of an effective and results-focused agenda and corresponding M&E system, coupled with relevant capacity development interventions at the institutional and technical staff levels. The absence of a culture of accountability (although improving at the top leadership level) has weakened the demand at various levels for an effective M&E system; a system that needs to be empowered and driven by enhanced political will and commitment at all levels.

44 These statistical system constraints are based on those outlined in the National Statistical Development Strategy (prepared by LISGIS, 2008).

These lessons gained during the implementation of PRS 1 highlight the preconditions for the successful implementation of the AfT M&E strategy:

• Political will and commitment to transparency, accountability and results at various levels of

Government.

• A coherent and updated results framework of AfT for each pillar and sector.

• A paradigm shift to embrace change and a results-focused approach to transformation.

• Rationalization and alignment of roles and responsibilities among relevant stakeholders, in line with the arrangements outlined above.

• Establishment of an enhanced incentive system to promote compliance and effective implementation of the M&E system.

• Increased M&E capacity development and an enhanced statistical support system at various levels.

• Expanded human and financial resources to implement the improved M&E system.

16.2 POLICY FRAMEWORK AND GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF AN ENHANCED M&E STRATEGY

The policy goals and targets for the AfT are ambitious but necessary. As stated throughout this report, this includes core areas of promoting sustained high and inclusive economic growth and employment opportunities; expanded access to strategic infrastructure (especially energy and roads) and other key services (notably education, health, water supply and sewage, social protection); substantial investments in people (especially youth); and strengthening a broad-based private sector. This results-focused policy and investment orientation requires an effective M&E system as a tool to help achieve the policy goals of the AfT.

The national M&E strategy for Liberia is being designed based on the following guiding principles:

• Managing for results: The focus will be on the expected outcomes/results of a public policy or program to emphasize the need for all interventions to contribute to improvements in Liberians' lives and welfare.

• Accountability: Institutions and accounting officers will be held answerable based on the agreed interventions and outputs and outcomes. There will be complementary reforms to strengthen accountability through performance contracts for the heads of selected M&As. Relevant performance information will be generated to inform key decisions in the planning and budgeting cycles.

• Demand driven: There will be one integrated M&E system, with different levels of data produced to meet the needs of key decision makers, multiple users, and diverse stakeholders.

• Data driven: Performance information, particularly statistical data, will be provided in a sound, reliable and timely way. This will require the active engagement of and support to LISGIS to produce the data required. MACs' capacity will also be strengthened to produce periodic reports with information on financial and non-financial performance.

• Ownership: M&E should be guided by national priorities, which will involve strengthening the capacity of sector MACs and county authorities. To promote transparency and partnership, development partners are encouraged to collaborate with and support government in all aspects and phases of the M&E plan. This will help minimize duplication, use resources for M&E more effectively, and promote synergies between and within sectors and stakeholders.

• Ethics and integrity: Impartiality and compliance with international standards should be promoted to ensure the credibility of the national M&E system.

16.3 OBJECTIVES OF AN INTEGRATED RESULTS-FOCUSED M&E STRATEGY

The primary objective of an enhanced M&E strategy is to support the effective and timely tracking and assessment of the results-focused objectives and interventions of the AfT, thereby contributing to enhanced achievement of its goals and the 2030 Vision.

The specific objectives of the M&E strategy and subsequent operational plan aim to:

• Ensure a focus on results by embedding M&E in the management culture and practices of sectors (particularly for the lead ministries and agencies), and county authorities, in the context of a phased decentralization.

• Provide an early warning system to address potentially problematic areas or processes of AfT implementation which may need corrective actions.

• Promote and institutionalize a coordinated, harmonized, and integrated M&E system by ensuring a strong linkage and alignment between the inputs and planned outputs in the national budget (through the MTEF process), and the goals, strategic objectives and outcomes outlined in the in the AfT.

• Clarify the roles and responsibilities of various MACs and other stakeholders involved in the M&E of public programs, as well as monitoring of strategic activities carried out by non-state actors.

• Enhance evidence-based decision making by key actors, including the Executive and the Legislature, and enable effective participation by other key stakeholders (including private sector and CSOs). Performance information and timely reports will be used to support policymaking, especially budget decisions, and to help MACs in their policy formulation and implementation of key programs/projects.

• Strengthen transparency and accountability, to foster partnerships and learning relationships and processes by MACs. This will improve the confidence of the Liberian people in the commitment and capacity of the Executive and the Legislature to hold ministries and agencies and county authorities to account for delivering value-for-money results which will benefit directly the majority of the Liberian population.

• Enhance institutional and technical commitment and capacities to manage and carry out an effective and demand-driven M&E system.

16.4 LINKS BETWEEN MTEF/BUDGET AND AFT MONITORING

A participatory process by ministries and agencies was used to align and link the MTEF and the AfT. The MTEF-AfT alignment exercise also provided an opportunity for establishing and agreeing on an integrated and coordinated M&E framework to track short-term outputs as well as the more strategic outcome indicators. This will help ensure that the national budget and the MTEF processes are moving toward achieving the overall results contained in the enhanced AfT.

As illustrated in Figure 16.1, the AfT preparation process has resulted in strengthening key linkages between the Vision 2030, the AfT strategy, Liberia's National Capacity Development Strategy (NCDS), the MTEF and an integrated monitoring plan.

Figure 16.1 Integrated Aft-MTEF-NCDS Monitoring and Planning

Results information is needed at the project, program and policy levels. All concerned organizations need to coordinate in sharing data. The results framework provides the unifying structure for guiding monitoring for different purposes. Task managers responsible for overseeing the delivery of interventions will focus on tracking inputs, activities and outputs in relevant work plans for budget accountability whereas senior managers will focus on results-measuring progress in achieving strategic objectives/outcomes and longer term development goals. In turn, both levels of monitoring will inform directly Liberia's National Capacity Development Strategy, highlighting which cross-cutting capacity development interventions are warranted.

16.5 SCOPE AND DESIGN OF THE INTEGRATED M&E SYSTEM

The design of the M&E strategy is based on a results chain that has been customized to fit Liberia's requirements. Figure 15,2 illustrates the various levels that have informed the AfT results framework, including short-term intermediate capacity outcomes and medium-term outcomes, which provides the core of the enhanced M&E system. This approach not only places emphasis on a results focus, but also emphasizes strong linkages with NCDS through identifying measureable intermediate capacity outcomes (ICOs) as an integral part of the results framework for the AfT. Accordingly, AfT has monitorable linkages with and supports NCDS in three ways:

• Monitors capacity changes: AfT provides outcomes to measure capacity development.

• Manages capacity resources: AfT provides outputs to track capacity development investments.

• Plans capacity development: AfT provides planning information to identify priority interventions and programmatic support for capacity development, including support from the National Capacity Development Fund (i.e., specific projects for capacity development that will have indicators that can be tracked).

Figure16.2. The Results Chain for Liberia

Operationally, the scope of the M&E strategy will cover key aspects of the AfT including: (a) implementation (i.e., inputs, activities and outputs); (b) strategic results, in terms of measureable outcomes; (c) strategic relevance of programs and activities; (d) efficiency, in terms of allocate (between sectors) and technical (implementation/value for money) aspects; (e) effectiveness; and (f) assessment of the impacts of AfT results and their sustainability.

Based on the information derived from the sector strategies, the results framework (see Annex 1) and the monitoring plan (see Annex 2) for the AfT complement each other by providing an operational roadmap of the results chain; strengthening the linkages and alignment between the MTEF and the AfT; and identifying the information requirements and flows for realizing a results-focused approach to development. As outlined above, the thrust of the M&E strategy is to develop an integrated and coordinated M&E plan, which will support the requirements of both the AfT and the MTEF. Accordingly, the monitoring plan is based on the results framework, and enables the identification of the SMART45 outcome indicators, baseline information, target outcomes, data sources and methods, and reporting frequency. Where there is full consistency between the AfT and MTEF indicators, these will be highlighted, and reported on through the newly developed budget management tool. Figure 3 illustrates the overall integrated M&E framework, which is underpinned by the results framework for each pillar and its component sector, and shows how the key elements are inter-related in accordance with the results chain analysis.

Figure 16.3: Overview of the Integrated M&E System

45 Good practice calls for designing and implementing SMART indicators: specific; measureable; attributable; realistic; and time bound. The AfT monitoring plan is based on these criteria.

16.6 MAIN CONTENT AND FUNCTION OF THE MONITORING PLAN

The AfT monitoring plan will focus explicitly on outcomes at the goal and strategic objective levels. The main content will include:

• Core set of SMART indicators to report on annually.

• Baseline and target values for each indicator against which progress can be tracked.

• The method or data source used for identifying current values for each indicator.

• The agency or department responsible for monitoring each indicator and the expected frequency for which indicator information will be reported.

This monitoring plan will be part of a more comprehensive M&E plan in a separate document that will also include the following information:

• Clear roles and responsibilities for all key M&E stakeholders-LRDC/AfT, MoF, LISGIS, ministry and agency M&E units, and county-level M&E units (see above table).

• An operational plan for M&E activities, including dissemination (how the information will be shared with stakeholders and used for program improvements); this plan will be prepared and launched during the second part of 2011.

• The detailed budget for enhancing the required M&E infrastructure and activities; it is important that there is adequate budgetary provision at the national and M&A levels, starting in FY13.

The formulation of the monitoring plan has resulted in a comprehensive list of SMART outcome indicators; further operationalization of the monitoring plan will derive a smaller number of CORE indicators (about 100) that will be identified, agreed upon and emphasized in implementing the monitoring plan and production of key reports. 46

16.7 GEOGRAPHICAL AND STAKEHOLDER ASPECTS

The AfT monitoring will be implemented at various geographic and sector levels. A strategic approach will be developed to ensure that needed data are entered into the monitoring system to be aggregated for overall reporting. Key geographical levels include:

• National level: aggregating M&E results to the national level, based on the measureable outcome indicators and evaluations.

• Local/county level: disaggregating key variables and stakeholders to the local level.

Data will be disaggregated by key stakeholder groups, including:

• Beneficiary target groups, including gender, youth, people with disabilities and other low income groups.

• Private sector, especially small and medium scale (agriculture, SMEs, others).

• Civil society organizations.

• Donor partners.

16.8 EVALUATION ASPECTS

The broader M&E plan (separate document) will specify how the M&E system will carry out analytical studies of selected and strategic themes to assess the strategic relevance, efficiency, effectiveness and impacts of the AFT. These studies will be carried out primarily by independent institutions, based on clear terms of reference, supervised and guided by the relevant government M&As (including steering groups, as relevant) to ensure quality and responsive evaluation outputs.

16.9 THE M&E INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND ROLES

Approach and principles:

• The national M&E strategy will build on and strengthen existing M&E arrangements and capacities of central and sectoral MACs, including clarification and coordination of roles, based on an updated assessment and detailed operational plan, to be guided by relevant decision makers and users.

• Statistical systems and the corresponding data collection activities by MACs will build on and improve, as necessary, existing institutional statistical systems, under the overall coordination of LISGIS, which will have a central role in the whole process.

46 The following criteria are being used to derive the core set of outcome indicators to enable a manageable and

strategically focused monitoring plan: reflect the high priority changes needed to achieve the overall goal of the AfT; reflect a spread of beneficiaries across government and non-government; represent all of the major constraint areas impeding the achievement of the pillar goal; cover critical interrelationships by encompassing objectives that relate to and support each other to address a goal (such as the community vs. public sector)

• The scope and improvements will be carried out in a phased manner, according to the available institutional capacities and resources, thereby emphasizing the need to focus on strategic priorities and a manageable M&E system.

16.10 INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK: ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

Overall framework: Based on the existing and required institutional mandates and AfT requirements, the following roles and responsibilities are envisioned:

This will be complemented with innovative monitoring and stakeholder or beneficiary feedback mechanisms and methods (including public expenditure tracking systems, beneficiary impact assessments). • Highlight constraints toward progress and recommend actions to improve implementation of the AfT, for the consideration by the M&E Steering Committee. • Provide technical backstopping and capacity development of the M&E units of the MACs. Composition of the unit will include the required statistical, sectoral and M&E specialists, based on clear TOR. An experienced officer will provide overall technical leadership.

• Coordinates with the National M&E Steering Committee, sectors and lead ministries to ensure demand and utilization of all statistics produced, including agreement on methods and survey.

• Provides technical backstopping and capacity development of the M&E units of MACs (especially the lead MACs).

B) Local/County Government

• County authorities (sub-offices of M&As, which will include specific M&E responsibilities) will be responsible for monitoring implementation of front-line service delivery at the county and district levels. These functions will involve preparing periodic reports (every quarter) of implementation and achievement of planning outputs and outcomes, identifying relevant implementation bottlenecks. The reports will be submitted to National M&E Unit, which will consolidate the results, and crosscheck the accuracy and reliability of the information. Senior level technical officers at the county and district levels (to be designated), based on clear TOR.

C) Private Sector

• They will focus on providing and facilitating relevant information, which involves the role of the private sector in the implementation of the AfT and achievement of the relevant outcome indicators. Research activities by academic institutions and consultant entities, which contribute to the M&E system, especially independent evaluation reports, will also provide an important role. Representatives from the private sector will also participate actively in the AfT National Steering Committee, the AfT M&E Steering, and the M&E Working Group. Selected representatives from the private sector (representing umbrella organizations, and especially small-and medium-scale enterprises and entities) that carry out independent evaluations to support the needs of AfT.

D) CSOs

• They will focus on providing and facilitating relevant information that involves the role of CSOs in the implementation of the AfT and achievement of the relevant outcome indicators. Representatives from CSOs will also participate actively in the AfT National Steering Committee, the AfT M&E Steering, and the M&E Working Group. Selected representatives from CSOs (representing umbrella organizations at the national and county levels, diverse stakeholders, and from different parts of the country to ensure inclusiveness).

E) Development Partners

• They will provide technical and financial support to the M&E strategy and operational plan; ensure integration of DP monitoring frameworks into Government systems, and capacity development for M&E. Selected representatives (usually M&E specialists) from DPs, especially those that providing technical and financial support to the AfT M&E system.

16.11 PROGRESS REPORTING, REVIEWS, AND COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES

Reporting will be the shared responsibility of the M&As, LISGIS, local government entities and the LDA Secretariat. The monitoring plans, which were based on well-designed templates (see Annex 2) and developed by participating MACs as part of the design of the AfT, are providing the main basis for the progress reporting of AfT. Monitoring will be undertaken on a quarterly basis by MACs and county authorities, with the active technical support of LISGIS, and coordinated by the National M&E Unit. The LRDC Secretariat, with the technical support of the M&E Unit, will:

• Prepare quarterly (especially at the output level through the MTEF process) semester and annual progress reports, which will focus on analyzing progress toward meeting strategic output and outcome (on an annual basis) targets, operational-level alignment between the MTEF/annual budget and the AfT. For the annual report, there would be an assessment of the linkages between strategic outputs and outcomes, in accordance with approved annual work/budget plans, identifying key policy and institutional level constraints and recommended actions needed to meet relevant measureable AfT goals. The semester level outcome progress reports will be submitted to the LDA Steering Committee and provide the main basis for their semester review meeting.

• Carry out a comprehensive midterm assessment (by early 2015), which will take a more in-depth and analytical approach to assessing progress toward meeting the pillar/sectoral goals and outcome targets (vis-à-vis the baseline figures and end-of-period targets). It is envisioned this will include an analytical performance assessment of selected strategic programs, especially involving key infrastructure (energy and roads); targeted access to basic social services (education, health, water supply and sanitation); and economic activities of key sectors. The midterm report will be submitted to the LDA Steering Committee to facilitate their decisions and further guidance to ensure the achievement of the targeted outcome goals and objectives of the AfT. The report will also distribute to key stakeholders to enable their inputs and continued participation.

• Arrange for an independent final evaluation, immediately prior to its completion, focusing on analyzing the emerging impacts of key sector goals and objectives. This evaluation needs to ensure it provides key inputs for the design of the next phase of the AfT. The evaluation report will be disseminated widely to key stakeholders, starting with the AfT Steering Committee.

Accordingly, M&E reporting will include the following aspects:

Measurable outcome indicators, with a focus on a core number, will result from preparing the detailed monitoring plans. These are presented in the previous pillar chapters, in accordance with supporting the sector goals and strategic objectives (summarized in Annex 2). The main types of financial outcome indicators will include aggregate per capita GDP, distribution of income, and consumption for key stakeholder groups. Non-financial outcome indicators will be drawn from and complemented by the Human Development Index for Liberia, progress toward the MDGs for Liberia, and the access of households to securing key infrastructure and social services.

16.12 UTILIZATION, COMMUNICATION, AND DISSEMINATION STRATEGY

The operationalization of the M&E strategy would produce and disseminate evidence to better inform public policy management by the relevant authorities, more effective utilization and management of resources, and strengthen multi-stakeholder participation in the implementation of the AfT. To ensure performance information is effectively used, the Government will ensure the following:

• Regular progress and performance reports are prepared and disseminated by the relevant M&As. These will be provided to decision makers as outlined above, especially in time to support the planning and budgeting calendar and decision-making processes.

• All M&As will be held accountable for the use of public resources as required by the PFM Act of 2009, and therefore the M&E information also will be utilized to inform the assessment of the performance contracts of key authorities.

• Summarized versions will be available to all stakeholders, once the reports have been reviewed and approved.

• The M&E plan will outline further detailed activities to ensure transparent dissemination and communication of the findings, with the aim of promoting more active multi-stakeholder participation toward achieving key AfT goals and objectives, as well as generating feedback to make needed adjustments.

CHAPTER 17. RISKS AND MITIGATION STRATEGIES

The AfT details the Government's plans for accelerating the evolution of the Liberian society and economy over the next five years. However, the plans are not without internal and external risks, including those outside the Government's control. The strategies detailed in the pillars of this Agenda for Transformation seek to directly or indirectly mitigate these risks. This section will highlight some of the most serious or likely risks that Liberia is exposed to, as well as Government actions that will seek to reduce the likelihood of these risks. Even though risks cannot be fully controlled, it may be possible to mitigate their adverse effects on the economy and society.

Security risks: By some accounts, post-conflict nations face a roughly 50 percent chance of relapsing into violence within one decade following the end of conflict. By 2013, Liberia will have crossed the 10-year mark since the end of its long civil war. Although peace prevails, both internal and external threats to security and peace remain. Internally, efforts at reconciliation are ongoing; however, the risks of renewed tensions between different factions of society are still present. While peace is fragile, renewed internal conflicts could be triggered by various events that are beyond the government's direct control, such as further economic crises, one-off acts of individual violence, turmoil in the political sphere, or accentuated instability in some of the neighboring countries that may entail cross-border activities.

Liberia is a young democracy and the threat of instability during periods of elections is real. Already during 2011, Liberia saw a heightened level of risk, acts of group vandalism, and sporadic violence in the run-up to, and aftermath of, the elections. Although the 2017 presidential election will come outside the formal AfT period, it may have a higher risk of violence than the 2011 election, and preventive measures will need to start during the AfT period. Rapid and inclusive economic growth and formal-sector job creation will not reach every citizen for at least a generation, and the gap between expectations and reality may contribute to mass mobilization for extra-electoral political acts. While democracy is still fragile, sudden non-democratic takeovers of power (such as those recently witnessed in Liberia's wealthier neighbor, Mali) represent a real risk. If they come to pass, a non-democratic takeover of power could endanger the institutional and economic gains made during years of peace.

In addition to internal risks, there are also risks of spillover of regional conflicts. The recent instability following disputed elections in Côte d'Ivoire has sent significant numbers of refugees into Liberia, which puts strain on the already difficult economic situation of border regions. Further, armed militias and rebel groups look to operate in these regions. These forces have been known to damage private property, ignite raids, attack security personnel, and attack and intimidate local villagers. The trafficking of goods and persons across the borders also poses risks to stability and security. The groups in charge of such activities can react dangerously to Government efforts to limit or control their illegal activity. All of these risks decrease the opportunity for the local population to fruitfully participate in economic recovery, investment, and growth.

In the midst of these risks, Liberia will be faced with taking over full responsibility for its security as substantial UNMIL forces, stationed in Liberia since 2003, execute their strategy of gradual drawdown. While Liberia has made significant gains in reforming its armed forces, the military and especially the police are still in need of continued reforms and strengthening. If the UNMIL drawdown proceeds too quickly and the local forces are not deemed able to fully take over responsibility, Liberia's internal and regional security could become jeopardized and crime and violence could increase. At the same time, if Liberia's military is too strong and unchecked, the risk of a non-democratic regime increases.

These various risks to peace and security have the ability to erode Liberia's achievement of its economic and development goals. Perceived insecurity and the threat of conflict significantly reduce the likelihood of productive investment, both foreign and domestic. For multinational companies, security risks increase the cost and reduce the likelihood of investment due to the heightened threat of expropriation or loss of investment. For SMEs, farmers, and regular Liberians, security risks also decrease the likelihood of investing in expanding one's farm or businesses because the perceived benefits of investment are less certain and subject to theft or vandalism. At their worst, security risks can threaten the hard-gained benefits of peace and lead to renewed disruptive conflict and loss of life.

Political economy risks: Liberia is a heterogeneous society and internal political economy issues are complex. At various points in Liberia's history, numerous cleavages have been made salient and strategically used by political leaders to either maintain power or destabilize it. These include regional divisions, ethnic and religious identities, political affiliation, generational differences, socio-economic status, and misuse of concession agreements involving Liberia's rich natural resource base.

Competition over natural resources: Across the world, countries that rely on natural resources for a large share of economic activity face a greater risk of internal instability, as groups in society and external actors compete to extract rents and control the benefits stemming from the resource. Thus, political competition is likely to be heightened in Liberia as revenues from extractive and natural resources increasingly come on line. Risks could arise if such competition is motivated by the desire to use government as a way to extract rents rather than to administer for the common good. Political economic tensions that are kindled by the presence of large-scale extractive industries can lead to the expected resource investment not taking place due to an increase in the perception of political risk.

Interest groups politics and reform: The AfT hinges on continued and accelerated political, economic, and bureaucratic reform. The history of countries around the world demonstrates that reform is difficult. Powerful actors in domestic politics often benefit from the status quo, having established positions of influence and channels for rent extraction. Even when growth proceeds as expected, it is likely to transform Liberian society and empower some segments relatively more than others. As growth leads to an evolution of interest groups, their resulting interests may not align with the Government's reform agenda. For example, if market power becomes concentrated in the hands of a few, they may seek to block the entry of new companies. Some interest groups may prefer weak rules and space for corruption over transparent rules and a competitive business environment. Such pressures give rise to the risk that growth can lead to weaker rules and institutions and a less, rather than more inclusive society, and more corruption.

Deficient checks and balances: As Liberia rebuilds its democracy, its political institutions are still being developed. Liberia is in the process of balancing power between the Executive, Legislative and Judiciary branches of Government, as well as undertaking a gradual de-concentration and decentralization from the capital to the counties and districts. Achieving collaboration among these three branches of government in pursuit of a comprehensive reform agenda to support the implementation of the AfT may at times prove difficult. Moreover, the unfinished process of decentralization introduces a dilemma to the central government institutions in that they must play a strong coordinating role to manage the Agenda while at the same time not over-centralizing decision making, which risks reducing the perceived legitimacy of the reforms.

Macroeconomic and budgetary/financing risks: Liberia's economy remains undiversified. For the foreseeable future, iron ore, rubber, timber, palm oil and potentially, petroleum are likely to account for the majority of the country's export basket and a significant share of government revenues. While the prices of these commodities on international markets are currently near all-time highs, a reversal in these trends would see export earnings and government revenue in Liberia fall below targets that are reflected in this Agenda. This scenario would adversely impact the Government's ability to invest through expanded budgetary resources and achieve the growth and outcome targets in various other sectors. A related risk is a shortfall in the funding from donors, especially on concessional terms.

Moreover, the relatively high prices of commodities are providing the incentive for multinational companies to invest in the development of these resources. Liberia' projections of high growth in top-line GDP and government revenue hinge on a handful of major investments taking place as envisioned. A decline or sustained delay in this process, whether due to lower commodity prices, increased perceived risk in Liberia, or other factors, would see a departure from assumed growth targets. Moreover, Liberia's development strategy hinges on geological features-specifically, the reopening of iron ore mines and the likely discovery of commercial quantities of petroleum. If for some reason, the minerals are not present in commercial quantities or they become uneconomical to extract, growth would be less robust than expected.

On the other hand, booming revenues from the concession sectors-mining, plantations, and possibly oil-could divert attention and resources away from SMEs and industries that produce for export and for competition with imports. This would leave Liberia under the resource curse and prevent it from attaining the envisioned middle-income status.

In addition to shocks to its exports, Liberia can also suffer as a result in increases in the prices of its key imports, most notably petroleum and rice. For example, in 2008 Liberia saw a sudden surge in the cost of imported rice and petroleum. Such sharp increases in the prices of staple goods can threaten livelihoods of the most vulnerable segments of society and can lead to pressure to deviate from stated policies or even unrest, as Liberia saw in the 1970s. For as long as Liberia is dependent on imports for some of its staple consumption goods, this risk will prevail.

Finally, given the depth of its current account deficit, Liberia depends on the continued availability of external financing, including donor funds, concessional loans and foreign investments. While government revenues are projected to increase, they still represent a small proportion (about 50 percent) of the investments required to bring infrastructure, social services and other government services to projected standards. Continued investment by development partners and foreign investors will be required to reach required targets. Continued volatility in the international economy can significantly increase the costs and decrease the availability of external finance for both governments and companies operating in developing countries. A lack of available financing could force the country to reduce its imports and investments in key infrastructure, which are currently one of the key drivers of the growth envisioned in the Agenda.

Capacity and implementation risks: The AfT makes significant demands on various parts of government as well as non-state change agents. The Agenda for Transformation is ambitious and will require substantial coordination within the various parts of the Government and between Government, development partners, civil society and the private sector. However, both human and institutional capacity, including intra-and inter-sector coordination capacities, are still low. Institutions for collaboration and coordination tools are still being built and tested. In 2012, for the first time, Liberia formulated a multi-year budget (i.e., MTEF). However, there were capacity weaknesses in identifying and formulating "transformative" priority interventions. The M&E strategy will switch from input management to outcome management. This change requires more capacity for data collection and technical analysis, which does not already exist in the public sector. If collaboration, administration, and continued monitoring activities are not managed successfully, both the financial and the operational targets envisaged in the Agenda may not be achieved.

Moreover, as a larger resource pool comes on line with the realization of resource revenues, fiduciary management issues will become more relevant. First, the financial management of a larger resource pool will increase the incentives for corruption and malpractice. Second, large procurement contracts related to the envisaged infrastructure investments will also raise opportunities for corruption. If mismanagement and corruption are perceived to be on the rise, the risk is that social tensions will be rekindled. A retrospective analysis of Liberia's history has identified the historic problems and vicious cycle related to economic management of concessions, corruption and lack of state capacity as among the key drivers of previous instances of conflict in Liberia.

Natural and environmental risks: While non-traditional economic sectors are expected to grow and contribute to sustainable growth in the future, at the present time most of Liberia's economy relies intensively on the use of land and extraction of natural resources. These activities pose significant environmental risks and challenges to sustainability. Lack of institutional capacity to design and enforce ecosystem management measures for activities in forestry and the exporting of timber can lead to deforestation, threatening biodiversity and the survival of the rainforest. Underdeveloped or inappropriate farming practices can cause soil erosion, leading to low yields and unsustainable land management and productivity. Large mines threaten land and river pollution. Development of offshore petroleum activities can lead to pollution of coastal waters from oil residues and spills, threatening coastal residents, tourism, and fishing industries.

Liberia is also subject to external environmental threats that are beyond its control. Global climate change and induced sea level rise could put at risk the livelihoods of already vulnerable coastal populations and the local fishing industry. Sea erosion in Buchanan, one of Liberia's key commercial cities, could limit its promise as a service hub. Increasingly unpredictable weather patterns could lead to challenges for farming households and to greater risk of natural disasters.

Interactions among risks: The various risks outlined above do not exist in isolation-rather they are highly interactive. For example, issues surrounding poor natural resource revenue management could raise social tensions and lead to security risks. Political economy issues that create poor incentives for economic diversification and SME creation could heighten the country's dependence on a few resources and increase its vulnerability to macroeconomic shocks. Low state capacity to manage resource revenues and citizen expectations for development and reform could raise political security risks. Unexpected environmental dangers, for example, could adversely affect farming output and the availability of local food, which could translate into heightened macroeconomic shocks and volatility. Therefore, the mitigation strategies are also often cross-cutting. They will be discussed next.

17.1 MITIGATION STRATEGIES

To reduce the likelihood of the risks to peace and security, the Government will pursue the goals outlined in the Peace, Security and Rule of Law Pillar. It will support strategic interventions that include continuing the process of reconciliation, strengthening the armed forces and the police force, and continuing efforts at regional collaboration in security matters. That said, the AfT is clear that economic transformation, as well as human development and improved governance, will serve to lower the risks of conflict and insecurity.

Strategies to lessen the political economic risks are embedded in each pillar as well as in the cross-cutting issues. The Government will work to empower diverse sectors of society and change agents, including of women, marginalized groups, youth and community-level organizations. It will continue to conduct development planning and budgetary processes in a consultative manner. To lessen the risks of infighting related to resource control, the government will work to strengthen the institutions in charge of negotiating and overseeing concessions contracts and associated revenues. Transparency, accountability and information sharing will be prioritized in every aspect of national revenues and expenditures. The country will work to continue the strengthening of the democratic process and the institutions that preserve democracy, such as the National Election Commission and independent media. Decentralization and the distribution of power between central and regional levels of government will continue.

In order to reduce macroeconomic risks, the Agenda envisages a host of activities that will have additional benefits in reducing political economic and security risks. Diversifying the economy will be a top priority, which will additionally de-concentrate economic power from the resource sectors and the government agencies that license natural resource activity. The Government will continue to support SMEs and new and viable export activities, offering a competitive fiscal, business and regulatory environment. Maintaining a competitive real exchange rate will be critical, and the policies to achieve this involves directing public spending toward infrastructure and human capital development that will enable expanding production of tradable goods and services-for export or to replace imports. Agricultural development, enhanced competitiveness, and modernization can improve the diversification of the economy, reduce poverty and improve food security (and hence risks on the import side), while limiting the damage to the rainforest. Liberia will continue to seek cooperation from external partners, but will manage the risk of reduced aid or investment by engaging with various counterparts in both the public and private sectors so as to assure redundant sources of foreign exchange for development purposes. The Government will also continue to focus on developing its domestic revenue base, and increase its own capacity to utilize domestic revenues for project finance.

The Agenda works alongside the National Capacity Development Strategy to manage risks of implementation related to capacity to deliver on the goals and outcomes of this document. The Government, in collaboration with non-state actors, will continue to work on growing its own capacity to manage resources and deliver goods and services to the population. It will bring on external support to assist in the effective monitoring and evaluation of the strategy, so as to manage most effectively for results while building internal capacity in this area. Most importantly, the Government will work with its partners to ensure that Liberian institutions-rather than parallel, donor-funded systems-are playing a leading role in implementation and the transformation processes. It will also designate a lead ministry for each of the pillars and sectors to help ensure effective coordination and accountability.

A focus on the environment will be integrated in all aspects of decision making, as the cross-cutting chapter makes clear. Beyond its people, Liberia's greatest asset is its land, and economic growth increases the pressure on the land as well as its value. The cross-cutting pillar outlines appropriate strategies to enhanced environmental sustainability of all of its interventions. Table 16.1 highlights these risks and mitigation measures and the responsible lead ministry.
