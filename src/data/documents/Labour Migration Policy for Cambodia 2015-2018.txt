FOREWORD

The Royal Government of Cambodia and the Ministry of Labour and Vocational Training is pleased to launch the Labour Migration Policy for Cambodia 2015-2018. This Policy builds on the previous Policy on Labour Migration for Cambodia 2010-2015, expanding on the three main objectives of (1) formulation and implementation of rights-based and gender-sensitive policy and legislation through social dialogue at all levels; (2) protection and empowerment of men and women migrant workers regardless of their status through all stages of the migration process; and (3) harnessing labour migration and mobility to enhance social and economic development in Cambodia recognising that migrant workers are agents of innovation and development. The Policy includes clear goals related to migration and development, migration management and the protection of migrant workers, and specific actions designed to achieve these goals. The document also provides a structure for monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the policy, filling an identified gap in the implementation of the previous policy.

The Labour Migration Policy for Cambodia 2015-2018 responds to the identified need for the Royal Government of Cambodia to introduce measures to ensure that new job seekers can be productively employed and develop their skills to be able to work in emerging, rather than vulnerable sectors in both Cambodia and destination countries. In this way the Policy and Action Plan links to the in-development Cambodia National Employment Policy, which supports the mobility of workers and protection of migrant workers under the goal of enhancing labour market governance, but also places employment generation (quantity and quality) at the heart of economic and social policy-making, focusing on young women and men. The Policy and Action Plan also links to the National Strategic Development Plan 2014-2018, which frames emigration as a population issue to work on in association with other line ministries and agencies, to strengthen its human resources for integrating population-related issues into the development planning processes at all levels for planners and policy makers. The Rectangular Strategy Phase III 2013-2018 also demonstrates a strong commitment by the Government to promote employment as a central part of their medium-term development strategy and institute a policy framework such that productive employment generation and economic development occur in tandem.

With aligned goals and timeframes included within the Labour Migration Policy for Cambodia, the National Employment Policy, the National Strategic Development Plan, and the Rectangular Strategy Phase III, the Department of Employment and Manpower, Ministry of Labour and Vocational Training, looks forward to collaborating through a whole-of- Government approach to labour migration management for positive outcomes for Cambodians. This Policy has the premise that when well-managed, labour migration can contribute to family and community development, and reduce poverty at community and national levels. Whilst the Royal Government of Cambodia does not view labour migration as the only avenue for pursuing Cambodia's long-term national economic and social development goals, the Royal Government of Cambodia is committed to ensuring that Cambodians are migrating for employment not out of necessity, but rather making an informed choice whilst being protected and empowered throughout the migration cycle.

  This Policy and Action Plan is the result of several consultations between the Royal Government of Cambodia, workers' and employers' organizations, recruitment agencies, civil society groups and international organizations. The Policy has also been reviewed against the recommendations emerging from the ASEAN Forum on Migrant Labour, to ensure coherence with regional priorities. I would like to express my gratitude to all parties involved in the development of this policy, especially to the International Labour Organization (ILO) for their invaluable technical support.

The Ministry of Labour and Vocational Training stands ready to guide policy-makers, line Ministries, civil society organizations and individuals towards the full and effective application and implementation of this Policy and Action Plan.

These consultations and the printing of this Policy were supported by the Australian Government. The MOLVT would like to express its gratitude for the valuable contributions to this endeavour from all stakeholders.

This Policy would not have been realized without the strong support and commitment of the senior officials of the General Department of Labour, including H.E. Hou Vuthy, Under Secretary of State; H.E. Seng Sakda, Director-General of General Department of Labour; Mr Chuop Narath, Deputy Director of General Department of Labour; Mr Ouk Ravuth, Chief of Bureau of Department of Employment and Manpower; and its dedicated staff members. The MOLVT would particularly like to express its appreciation to the ILO, and in particular Ms Jane Hodge, Mr Rim Khleang, Ms Anna Olsen and Mr Max Tunon, from the ILO GMS TRIANGLE project, for providing guidance and technical input throughout the process.

 

Executive summary

The Labour Migration Policy for Cambodia 2015-2018 sets out a framework from which to govern labour migration effectively, empower and protect the rights of women and men migrant workers, and enhance the impact of migration on development. It is based on an analysis of the current context of labour migration in Cambodia, including figures and trends in relation to sectors and destinations, the gendered dimensions of migration, and the national, bilateral, regional and international regulatory and institutional frameworks. Economic growth and employment trends in Cambodia are also examined, as is the demographic pressure of an increasingly large youth workforce, the large percentage of informal employment, and what regional integration spurred by the ASEAN Economic Community in 2015 could mean for Cambodia.

The overall Policy objective is to develop a comprehensive and effective labour migration governance framework that protects and empowers women and men throughout the migration cycle, ensures that migration is an informed choice, and enables a positive and profitable experience for individual workers, their families and communities, that also contributes to the development of Cambodia. Recognizing and responding to the distinct needs of migrant workers with respect to their gender, sector, legal status and other individual characteristics, is central to the Policy and its effective implementation.

The Policy delineates three specific objectives: (1) formulation and implementation of rights-based and gender-sensitive policy and legislation through social dialogue at all levels; (2) protection and empowerment of men and women migrant workers regardless of their status through all stages of the migration process; and (3) harnessing labour migration and mobility to enhance social and economic development in Cambodia recognising that migrant workers are agents of innovation and development.

The following policy goals are proposed under these three specific objectives: Governance of labour migration

Policy goal 1: International standards and instruments related to labour migration and migrant workers are reviewed with respect to the Cambodian context and legal framework, and ratified and implemented in a gender-sensitive manner.

Policy goal 2: The Government contributes to multilateral and regional cooperation on labour migration, particularly within ASEAN, with a clear vision of how ASEAN regional integration and the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) can enhance decent work opportunities for all migrant workers.

Policy goal 3: In consultation with social partners and civil society organizations, the Government establishes gender-sensitive, sector specific minimum standards for MOUs with destination countries as a condition of sending, and key articles for contracts with employers prior to sending any workers abroad.

Policy goal 4: The MOLVT invests in the capacity of the relevant bodies at central and provincial levels, and takes a leadership role in strengthening inter-ministerial cooperation on labour migration, including actively contributing to the Migration Working Group of the National Committee to Counter Human Trafficking.

 

Policy goal 5: New legislation and regulations are considered only where gaps are identified, and developed to reflect the specific and distinct needs of women and men migrants through tripartite consultation. Procedures related to labour migration are streamlined to incentivise regular migration and protect workers' rights.

Policy goal 6: Sex-disaggregated data is collected and analysed on a regular basis to inform evidence-based policy that is tailored to and addresses the experiences of women and men migrant workers.

Protection and empowerment of men and women migrant workers

Policy goal 7: The Government monitors and enforces protection mechanisms in the recruitment and placement of migrant workers, including institutionalising inspection of private recruitment agencies, the delivery of pre-departure training, and regulating the costs of migration, including brokerage fees.

Policy goal 8: Unlicensed brokers or agents, or licensed recruitment agencies linked to exploitative or unscrupulous practices, are targeted with appropriate sanctions to reduce irregular migration and reduce the vulnerability of migrant workers.

Policy goal 9: Government consular services are established or enhanced in major destination countries to provide effective assistance to men and women migrant workers regardless of their status, including shelter, legal, labour dispute, social protection and repatriation facilities.

Policy goal 10: Migrants' access to justice is facilitated through implementing the complaints mechanism in an effective, gender-sensitive and timely manner. In the event of a crime, judicial processes are initiated to ensure an adequate penalty, and a deterrent to others.

Policy goal 11: The Government facilitates migrants' access to vocational training programs to develop and recognize the skills of migrant workers as a measure to enhance protection and earning potential. Training programmes and skills recognition systems are developed for women and men in consultation with employers and governments of destination countries, according to labour market needs, in specific occupations and sectors.

Policy goal 12: The Government cooperates with local leaders, social partners and civil society organizations to provide accurate and up-to-date information on safe migration and rights at work in major migrant-sending communities and in transit hubs.

Policy goal 13: Feasibility studies are conducted by the Government on further protection mechanisms for men and women migrant workers such as the revolving credit and loan funds, and migrant welfare funds to assist men and women migrant workers with migration.

Harnessing labour migration for development

  Policy goal 14: Labour migration continues to be included within national development and sectorial plans to recognize and maximise the development potential of migration for Cambodia, and ensure coherent development planning.

Policy goal 15: The Government works with financial institutions in Cambodia and destination countries to enable access to safe, efficient and cheaper remittance and financial services for migrant workers. The impact of remittances on development is enhanced through support services provided to migrants and their families, including gender-sensitive financial literacy training, a broader range of financial services and products, and dialogue and tools for diaspora engagement.

Policy goal 16: Productive return and reintegration of women and men migrant workers is enabled through evidence-based policy, and strengthened service provision for social and economic reintegration, including employment services, skills development and recognition, enterprise development training, and investment programmes.

Policy goal 17: The social cost of migration is mitigated through specific programmes, including through the provision of support to the families and children of migrant workers.

Under each policy goal, action points are identified that are to be initiated by the responsible agencies. The policy document serves as a road map for the Government in its dialogue with social partners, international organizations and the donor community, to more effectively carry out measures to enhance the positive development outcomes of migration, and establish means to assess the achievement of results.

Introduction

With 300,000 young Cambodians entering the labour market each year, a youth unemployment rate of 3.8 per cent, and economic growth not achieving commensurate employment growth, more Cambodian workers are looking to employment opportunities and wages offered abroad. Increasingly, Cambodian women are migrating to find work that allows them to support their families. It is estimated that much higher numbers of migrant workers move irregularly than regularly, but because of porous borders and seasonal migration flows, it is difficult to obtain accurate figures. In this Policy when the term 'migrant worker' is used, it refers to a person who will be engaged, is engaged, or has been engaged in a remunerated activity in a State of which he or she is not a national, and refers to both regular and irregular men and women migrant workers.

The main country of destination for regular and irregular Cambodian migrant workers is neighbouring Thailand. Due to the relative ease of border crossing, less than 10 per cent of people migrate through the legal channel established under the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the two countries in 20031. Since 2010, the Republic of Korea has become the second most popular destination. The number of migrant workers going to Malaysia peaked in the period from 2009 to 2011, despite the lack of an MOU in place, but this number dropped dramatically after the suspension of sending domestic workers through regular channels. Cambodia also concluded an MOU with Japan, but far fewer migrants travel there for work, due to the technical requirements through the Industrial Training Program and Technical Internship Program.

Cambodia has yet to develop a comprehensive policy strategy on how to maximize the opportunities of greater labour mobility of workers within the ASEAN region with the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) coming into effect in 2015. Currently, only one per cent of the Cambodian workforce qualifies for the freer movement of professional workers for which mutual recognition arrangements (MRAs) exist. It is expected that greater regional integration will also lead to increased mobility for semi-skilled workers. The continued demand for low- and medium- skilled migrant workers within the major destination countries in ASEAN is projected to remain high, with 80 per cent of inter-ASEAN migration flowing to Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand.

Importantly, the Government aims to ensure that migration is a choice, not a necessity. Labour migration is only one component of the National Employment Policy, which aims to generate employment and create better jobs at home. Labour migration is also streamlined into the National Strategic Development Plan 2014-2018, framing emigration as a potential tool to strengthen Cambodia's human resources, and the Rectangular Strategy Phase III 2013-2018 that demonstrates a Government commitment to promote employment and institute a policy framework so that productive employment generation and economic development occur in tandem. Support must be available for Cambodians to make informed decisions about migration, and opportunities for them to migrate safely, legally and into decent work.

Over the past few years the Royal Government of Cambodia has seen positive outcomes of migration including increasing remittances, skills acquisition, lower unemployment, and poverty

  reduction. While there has been demonstrated progress governing labour migration and protecting migrant workers, these positive results could have an enhanced impact on individual, community and national level development by establishing policies and programmes on the return and reintegration of workers, reducing migration costs and engaging Cambodian returned migrants. This requires improved cooperation between all stakeholders in Cambodia, led by an inter-ministerial Government team.

This policy document outlines the Royal Government of Cambodia's policy goals on labour migration and the activities designed to achieve these goals.

1. Labour migration: Current context

As a result of the large number of young people entering the domestic labour market with limited opportunities and more attractive wages offered abroad, more Cambodians are considering leaving the country to find work. In 2010, the World Bank estimated there were 350,485 Cambodian workers migrating for employment.2 However, the number is likely much greater, with approximately 700,000 Cambodian migrants with irregular status registering with the Thai authorities from July to October 2014 (Table 1).

Cambodia's population is expected to grow until 2015 at an average rate of 1.3 per cent per year, while the working-age population (aged 15-64) will grow at a higher average annual rate of 3 per cent. As an estimated 300,000 young Cambodians enter the labour market every year3 and with 60.1 per cent of the Cambodian population under 29 years of age4, the Government faces the challenge of equipping these young people with the required skills to meet the needs of the labour market, providing job-matching services - and where necessary, facilitating their mobility.

1.1 Wages

A key factor for Cambodian workers in choosing to migrate for work is the wage differential between Cambodia and destination countries. In 2012, 60.2 per cent of total employed people in Cambodia worked in informal employment, while only 6.5 per cent were salaried employees in the formal sector.5 Even for this small amount of salaried employees, there is no standardised form or frequency of payment (some employees are paid on a time-rate basis, others on a piece-rate basis; payment is in cash or in kind) and there is no established minimum wage in legislation, except for garment workers.6 The estimated average monthly income of paid employees in 2012 was 477,517 Cambodian Riel (KHR) (US$119).7 On average, men earn around KHR 518,202 (US$130), which is more than women who earn on average KHR 418,808 (US$105). In some occupations, the difference in the earnings between male and female employees is larger, particularly for managers and technicians. In urban areas, managers earn

13   the highest average monthly income at KHR 924,815 (US$231), followed by technicians at KHR 750,728 (US$188). In rural areas, technicians earn the highest average monthly income at KHR 606,973 (US$152), followed by skilled agriculture workers at KHR 595,565 (US$149).8

In comparison, Thailand has a minimum wage of 300 Thai Baht (THB) per day, roughly equating to THB 9,000 per month (US$279) full-time.9 While Thai labour law and the MOU with Cambodia states that migrant workers should also receive the wage and other benefits due to local workers, more men than women receive the minimum wage.10 In general, migrants with full or temporary documentation earned higher incomes, whereas 65 per cent of migrants who earned less than half of the minimum wage were without documentation.11

In a 2014 International Organization for Migration (IOM) study, it was found that the income levels of migrants differed greatly by province of residence - in non-border provinces such as, Bangkok, Samut Sakhon and Surat Thani, 90.1, 84.3 and 93.1 per cent respectively, of migrants received at least the minimum wage.12 Incomes were generally lower in border provinces, especially in Tak, where 91.5 per cent of migrants received less than the minimum wage, and half received less than half of the minimum wage. Significant sectoral differences were also evident, for example, agriculture and animal husbandry was shown to be a highly underpaid employment sector. Thailand's Labour Protection Act does not extend minimum wage protection to workers in the fishing, agriculture and domestic work sectors.

In Peninsular Malaysia, the monthly minimum wage is 900 Malaysian ringgit or KHR 1,188,000 (US$295).13 This minimum wage applies to nationals and migrant workers, but not to domestic workers, the vast majority of whom are women. Deductions made from migrant workers' wages to cover the costs of the levy (varies according to sector) can equate to up to 16 per cent of the migrants' annual basic income.14

In the Republic of Korea, the minimum wage is 1,015,740 South Korean Won (US$922) per month, based on the hourly minimum wage and the average number of 40 working hours per week.15 Under the Employment Permit System (EPS), migrant workers are afforded equal rights and treatment to Korean workers under Korean labour laws and regulations.

Across all destination countries however, migrant workers with irregular status are less likely to be able to access the minimum wage protections.

1.2 Gender dimensions of labour migration

Although the gender gap in labour force participation in Cambodia is shrinking, women's

 unemployment rate is higher than men's, and a larger proportion of women workers are illiterate16. In 2012, slightly over 20 per cent of Cambodian women had never attended school, almost twice the percentage of men.17 Migration trends often see more educated women migrating to Phnom Penh from provincial areas, and women with lower levels of education migrating internationally.18 Given women's higher unemployment rates and their lower education levels, women are typically more vulnerable than men to exploitation in the workplace.

Women tend to receive lower wages than their male counterparts but, despite this, are more likely to remit larger net amounts, and are more likely to remit a higher proportion of their income, and at an average 20 per cent more than men migrants. About 32 per cent of men do not remit at all, compared to 23 per cent of women. 39 per cent of women remitted one million or more KHR (US$242) per year, compared to 26 per cent of men.

Cambodian women migrant workers tend to migrate into low-skilled jobs in the construction, agriculture, manufacturing, entertainment, hospitality and domestic work industries. Domestic work in private homes is a particularly vulnerable sector, due to the isolated nature of the workplace and limited or non-existent protection under labour laws. Reports of abuse and exploitation of domestic workers have been recorded in all countries where Cambodian domestic workers are employed. With an ageing population in bordering Thailand and in countries like Malaysia and Singapore, demand for domestic workers in the region is expected to continue to grow.

Occupations for migrants are often gender segregated, and women are regularly paid less than men. An ILO survey of potential migrants in Cambodia found that, while the median salary expectation among potential migrants was US$101-200 per month, 54 per cent of men surveyed expected this wage, compared to only 43 per cent of women. Of the potential migrants expecting to receive US$201-500 per month, 27 per cent were men and 16 per cent were women.19 Women are more likely to remit larger net amounts, and are more likely to remit a higher proportion of their income, and at an average 20 per cent more than men migrants20. About 32 per cent of men do not remit at all, compared to 23 per cent of women. 39 per cent of women remitted one million or more KHR (US$242) per year, compared to 26 per cent of men.21

In 2010, Cambodian recruitment agencies trained and sent 16,397 workers to Malaysia, of which 11,918 were women trained as domestic workers. This was an increase from 9,982 Cambodians who migrated to Malaysia in 2009 (84 per of whom were female domestic workers), and 2,654 in 2008 (73 per cent of whom were female domestic workers) (Table 3). In Thailand, the number of women migrant workers deployed through legal channels has substantially increased from 1,345 women in 2005, to the peak of 19,282 women migrant workers in 2010 (Table 3). In contrast to Malaysia, women's and men's rates of regular migration to Thailand have stayed fairly even, most likely due to the diversity of work sectors.

  As of 31 October 2014, 696,388 migrant workers and 42,609 dependents from Cambodia had registered at the Thai One Stop Service Centres through the nationality verification (NV) processes (Table 1).

As of November 2014, 299 Cambodian domestic workers had been deployed to Singapore as part of a pilot project. The pilot project will send 400 Cambodian domestic workers to Singapore through private recruitment agencies (PRAs) to see if this is a viable migration option in the future.

In contrast, the fishing sector is almost entirely male dominated, and employs significant numbers of Cambodian migrant men. Since 2010, there have been increased reports of Cambodian men encountering exploitative and abusive working conditions on fishing boats in South Africa, Senegal, Fiji, Mauritius, Thailand and other destinations. In the first quarter of 2012 alone, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (MOFA&IC) and the Ministry of Interior (MOI) each reported between 170 and 200 cases of exploitation and abuse involving fishers. Whilst the Cambodian Government has not put a formal ban on recruiting and sending Cambodians overseas to work on fishing vessels, the Government has made several statements indicating they do not support regular migration through PRAs into the fishing industry.

1.3 Mass exodus of Cambodians from Thailand in 2014

In June 2014, more than 250,000 Cambodian migrant workers returned to Cambodia from Thailand, prompted by fear of arrest by Thai authorities and the unstable political situation in Thailand. The majority of returning migrants were undocumented, and some were travelling with families and young children. Of the 667 returned migrants interviewed in an IOM study, 53 per cent were women, and 70 per cent of respondents were between 20-40 years old.22 Over one-third (38 per cent) of respondents had not completed primary school, and more than two-thirds migrated to Thailand because they had no job or income in Cambodia. When asked what type of assistance they most needed in Cambodia, 78.4 per cent of respondents said they required help in finding a job, and 60.3 per cent required vocational skill training.23

The Cambodian Government was quick to react to the return of migrants, and aimed to simplify and make regular migration more affordable, by issuing Sub-decree No. 205, reducing the cost of passports for migrant workers to US$4, and inter-ministerial prakas No. 2574, stating that migrant workers could apply for their passports at the Provincial Offices of Passport of the MOI and Provincial Departments of Labour and Vocational Training (PDOLVTs). Prakas No. 2574 also states that the MOLVT will establish one window services for Khmer workers who have worked and are working in Thailand, at four border check points (Banteay Mearnchey, Pailin, Koh Kong, and Oudor Mearnchey). As of July 2014, there was one provincial passport office in Battambang, and MOLVT was in the process of establishing the one window services in other provinces. Early analysis indicated that these options were not taken up by migrant workers, most of whom returned to Thailand and subsequently registered with the Thai authorities. This exodus of migrant workers underlines the need for coherent policies on labour migration that is better able to provide migrant workers with regular migration options, and which invests in support for the return and reintegration of migrants to Cambodia.

2. Demographic pressure

In 2012, Cambodia's total estimated population was 14.9 million; 7.6 million (51 per cent) female and 7.3 million (49 per cent) male24. As a result of the post-war baby boom, the population is young, with those aged 29 years and under comprising 60.1 per cent of the total population, those aged 30-59 comprising 32.4 per cent of the population, and those aged over 60 comprising only 7.6 per cent of the population25.

The annual population growth rate registered from 2008-2013 was 1.46 per cent, higher than that of Southeast Asia (1.1 per cent), and much higher than that of Thailand (0.5 per cent), or Viet Nam (1 per cent), but lower than the growth rate of Lao PDR (1.7 per cent)26.

3. Labour migration trends and frameworks

3.1 Labour migration trends

Thailand In 2003, the Governments of Thailand and Cambodia signed an MOU on employment cooperation as a part of the regulatory framework for labour migration, including reference within the MOU for the need for policies to manage irregular migrants. The number of migrants using legal channels to migrate to Thailand increased from 9,476 in 2007 to 34,804 in 2012, but then declined again in 2013 (Table 3), at least in part due to the repeated regularization opportunities in Thailand, the ability to avoid deportation, and limited additional protection provided by regular migration.

  In mid-2011, Thai authorities' commenced registration, and Thai and Cambodian authorities together commenced NV processes to facilitate the regularization of workers who either migrated through irregular channels, or whose regular migrant status had lapsed.

In late June 2014, following the exodus of Cambodian workers from Thailand, the Thai National Committee for Peace and Order (NCPO) opened a new registration window for irregular migrant workers, until 31 October 2014. As of October 2014, 696,388 migrant workers and 42,609 dependents had registered through the OSSCs (Table 1). The procedures and timing for NV is currently in discussion between the Thai Government and countries of origin.

  Malaysia Malaysia is a major destination country for Cambodian migrant workers; from 2005 to 2010, legal migration to Malaysia increased from 1,776 to 16,394 (Table 3). The demand for Cambodian domestic workers increased dramatically after the Indonesian Government suspended sending domestic workers to Malaysia in 2009. Following a series of reports of abuse and exploitation, in October 2011 the Cambodian Government imposed a temporary ban on sending domestic workers to Malaysia. In 2014, Cambodia and Malaysia continued negotiations on two separate MOUs to restart the sending of domestic workers and 'general' workers, or workers in other sectors.

Republic of Korea Sub-decree No. 70 issued in July 2006, on the Creation of the Manpower Training and Overseas Sending Board (MTOSB), is a Government-to-Government system designed specifically to regulate the sending of Cambodian workers to the Republic of Korea. The MTOSB oversees the recruitment, training, and sending of workers to the Republic of Korea through the EPS, which allows Korean small and medium-sized enterprises who have not been able to recruit local workers to recruit internationally in the manufacturing, construction, agriculture and livestock, fishing, and service industry sectors. To qualify under the EPS, workers must demonstrate a sufficient level of language and job skills. The EPS involves training prior to departure, support while in country, and skills and job matching services upon return. Four types of insurance are available to migrant workers - workers' compensation insurance, health insurance, pension insurance and employment insurance. Since 2006, 27,384 Cambodians have migrated to Korea for work, however there has been a significant increase in migration to Korea since 2010.

Other destination countries The MOU between the Kingdom of Cambodia and the Japan International Training Cooperation Organization (JITCO) on the management of the sending of Cambodian trainees to Japan has resulted in 601 Cambodian migrant workers being deployed since 2007. The MOUs with the State of Qatar and the Government of the State of Kuwait were signed in 2011 and 2009 respectively but, as yet, no Cambodian migrant workers have been sent through these channels.

3.2 Remittances In 2011, the World Bank estimated that Cambodian migrants sent home US$354 million in remittances, not including the remittances sent through non-official channels.27 In comparison, net foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows to Cambodia were US$800 million, and net overseas development aid (ODA) for Cambodia was US$700 million in the same year.28 Forty per cent of Cambodian migrant workers in Thailand reported that remittances were the main sources of income for their families, and the money was mainly spent on daily expenses, health care, and household appliances.29 Women migrants remit on average 20 per cent more than men migrants.30

  There has been limited research and programming on remittances and harnessing these funds for productive investment and development in Cambodia.

3.3 National regulatory and legal framework In recent years, the Royal Government of Cambodia has strengthened the framework for labour migration governance. In August 2011, the Government adopted Sub-Decree No. 190 on the Management of Sending of Cambodian Workers Abroad through Private Recruitment Agencies. The Sub-Decree strengthened the regulatory framework for governing labour migration and protecting migrant workers, and acknowledges the potential impact of migration on poverty reduction and human resource development.

In 2013, the adoption of eight prakas to support Sub-Decree 190 provided greater clarity to authorities on their roles and responsibilities. These prakas were drafted and reviewed through consultation with social partners and civil society organizations, drawing on extensive inputs from the ILO. Efforts have been made to ensure that the prakas are gender-sensitive through reviews of draft legislation by UN Women and MOWA.

Eight prakas adopted in February and September 2013; o Prakas No 045/13 concerning the use of terms outlines the meaning of key terms used in Sub-Decree 190.

o Prakas No 047/13 concerning private recruitment agency outlines the requirements of a private recruitment agency to be recognised as a legal entity from the MOLVT. o Prakas No 046/13 concerning the recruitment process and pre-departure orientation sets minimum standards for private recruitment agencies in their legal responsibilities to migrant workers prior to being sent abroad.

o Prakas No 249 concerning complaint receiving mechanism for migrant workers outlines the MOLVT complaints process for migrant workers.

o Prakas No 250 concerning inspection on private recruitment agency outlines the MOLVTs standards for inspections.

o Prakas No 251 concerning penalty and reward to the private recruitment agency stipulates that private recruitment agencies will be inspected every two years, and that they must meet a certain minimum standard in order to continue to operate.

o Prakas No 252 concerning on-site service of the private recruitment agency and repatriation outlines the private recruitment agencies responsibilities to migrant workers in destination countries and during repatriation processes.

o Prakas No 253 concerning promulgation of minimum standards of job placement services abroad contract stipulates all articles that need to be included in the contract between the private recruitment agency and Cambodian migrant worker.

To be licensed, a recruitment agency must receive authorisation from the MOLVT as per Sub-decree No. 190 and prakas No. 47. Together these instruments stipulate that recruitment agencies must not sub-contract any part of their licence, that they are responsible for migrant workers pre-departure, during placement abroad, and repatriation, that they must provide predeparture training, and have a permanent representative in the destination country for migrant workers' welfare. Recruitment agencies must sign an agreement with MOLVT, pay a guarantee deposit of US$100,000, and report on a monthly, quarterly, semesterly and yearly basis. If recruitment agencies do not satisfy these requirements, MOLVT has the power to refuse to

  issue a license, issue a warning to the recruitment agency, or discontinue their license. The number of licensed recruitment agencies increased from 18 in 2008 to 55 in 2014, with all 55 recruitment agencies reportedly being members of the Association of Cambodian Recruitment Agencies (ACRA). ACRA was established in 2008 and promotes the orderly and safe migration of Cambodian migrant workers, and brings together licensed recruitment agencies into a voluntary industry body.

A number of other laws, sub-decrees and prakas also provide protection to migrant workers: Sub-decree No. 205 on provision of ordinary passport was passed after the mass exodus of Cambodian migrant workers from Thailand in June 2014. In Cambodia, the provision of passports is managed by the MOI and can currently only be obtained from MOI Passport Departments in Phnom Penh and Battambang. Historically, many Cambodian migrant workers travel without passports due to the complex process to issue passports and the ease of border crossing.

 Sub-decree No. 205 on provision of ordinary passport to Khmer worker and student stipulates that passports for migrant workers must be paid for by the government, and migrant workers must only pay US$4 for the passport photo.

 Inter-ministerial prakas No 2574 on format and procedure for issuance of normal passport for Khmer workers to work legally abroad stipulates that migrant workers themselves will get their passports at the Passport Department in the office of the MOI in Phnom Penh and MOI Provincial Passport Offices - as of July 2014 there was one provincial passport office in Battambang.

The Cambodian Law on Suppression of Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation and the Penal Code include provisions that govern the acts of trafficking, exploitative recruitment, illegal confinement and fraud and forgery (in relation to false identification) by an offender or attempted offender, committed in Cambodia or on a flight or vessel that flies the Cambodian flag, in any territory where the perpetrator or victim is a Cambodian citizen. The Cambodian Civil Code and Sub-decree No. 38 Referring to Contract and Other Liabilities, include provisions for breach of contract, misrepresentation, voidability of contracts and tortious liability (including negligence). As such, these two legal instruments could be referred to when a worker has been exploited or deceived into a contractual situation but does not have the evidence or inclination to pursue a criminal claim. To date, however, these legal instruments have not been referred to or utilised to assist with civil claims, and few criminal cases relating to labour migration have been pursued with only a handful being pursued successfully. The Cambodian Labour Law applies only to work to be completed in Cambodia and does not apply to work to be completed abroad.

Improving implementation of the legal and policy framework requires further investment in the capacity of labour authorities and other departments and stakeholders at the central and provincial levels. Training on the above prakas by the MOLVT was run in 2014 for all PDOLVT Directors, Chief of Bureaus and Chairs of the provincial-level National Committees to Counter Human Trafficking (NCCT). The Royal Government of Cambodia now also has tools for implementation such as the complaints mechanism, forms and database, and the standardised Pre-Departure Orientation Curriculum for Thailand and Malaysia, for which a training-of-trainers course was conducted in November 2014.

  3.4 Institutional framework The General Department of Labour, MOLVT is the primary body governing labour migration, in association with MOFA&IC and MOI. The General Department of Labour has five subdepartments: (i) labour inspections, (ii) labour disputes, (iii) employment and manpower, (iv) child labour, and (v) occupational health. According to Prakas No. 218 on Reform of Organisation and Functioning of Department of Employment and Manpower dated 10 September 2014, the Department of Employment and Manpower is the secretariat of the General Department of Labour, and is tasked with protection and management of Khmer workers in Cambodia and overseas. The Department is structured with nine offices responsible for (i) public relations, (ii) management of alien workers, (iii) monitoring and inspection of alien workers, (iv) monitoring of Khmer workers, (v) employment and manpower statistics, (vi) job placement in Cambodia, (vii) job placement office for Malaysia and Arabic Countries, (viii) job placement office for Thailand, (ix) job placement office for Japan, Singapore and all other countries.

The Inter-Ministerial Working Group for the Implementation of the MOU with Thailand comprises the MOLVT, MOI, and MOFA&IC, and meets annually before meeting with the Royal Government of Thailand to discuss progress of implementation of the MOU between the two countries.

Coming out of the consultations for the Labour Migration Policy for Cambodia, establishing a Sub-Committee on Labour Migration under the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Examining and Preparing the National Employment Policy chaired by MOLVT that will annually review progress and identify priorities for the upcoming year was discussed.

3.5 International instruments Cambodia has ratified all eight core ILO Conventions, is a signatory to the UN International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families (1990), and has ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) (1979), and the Optional Protocol to CEDAW (1999). The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women issued General Recommendation No. 26 (December 2008) on women migrant workers, that describes the obligations of State parties to respect, protect, and fulfil the human rights of women migrant workers.

Cambodia has not ratified ILO Convention No. 97 on the Migration for Employment Convention (revised 1949), ILO Convention No. 143 on the Migrations in Abusive Conditions and the Promotion of Equality of Opportunity and Treatment of Migrant Workers Convention (1975). The Government has not ratified other important migration governance conventions including ILO Convention No. 189 Domestic Workers Convention (2011), ILO Convention No. 188 on Work in Fishing, ILO Convention No. 181 on Private Employment Agencies (1997), ILO Protocol on Forced Labour (2014), and the UN International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families (1990).

3.6 Regional instruments Cambodia is a signatory to the ASEAN Declaration on the Protection and Promotion of the Rights of Migrant Workers, adopted by the Heads of Government in 2007 in Cebu. MOLVT has been actively involved in the regional discussions on the drafting of a new ASEAN Agreement

  the ASEAN Declaration on Strengthening Social Protection adopted by the Heads of Government in 2013 in Brunei. With the advent of AEC in 2015, MOLVT will strategize with associations representing workers and employers on how Cambodia can benefit from this development. In addition, MOLVT will participate in bilateral and regional discussions on, among other things, skills recognition, data sharing, and social security transfer and portability.

3.7 Nexus between labour migration and trafficking in Cambodia The nexus between labour migration and human trafficking is globally recognised. According to ILO estimates in 201231, more women than men are in forced labour, though men are more likely to be in forced labour exploitation. Women migrants are particularly at risk because of low levels of education, limited access to formal employment and higher representation in especially high-risk workplaces, including homes and entertainment venues32. Some efforts to link the reduction of human trafficking through better governance of migration have been made by the various institutions of the Royal Cambodian Government, as outlined below.

In September 2012, a Migration Working Group was established under the Secretariat of the NCCT. The overall purpose of the Group is to "promote and protect the safety, rights, and interests of migrants in a way that is gender responsive by using a multi-disciplinary and multi-sectoral approach." The NGO community and international organizations have established a regular forum to discuss labour migration and trafficking, and coordinate responses.

In October 2014, the Royal Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia and the Royal Government of the Kingdom of Thailand, renewed the MOU on Bilateral Cooperation for Eliminating Trafficking in Persons and Protecting Victims of Trafficking first signed in 2003.

4. Economic growth and employment trends

In the decade prior to the 2008 global financial crisis, Cambodia grew at an average economic annual rate of over 9.1 per cent.33 Since the global financial crisis the economy has recovered well, growing at an average of seven per cent between 2009 and 2012. This economic development helped employment rates to grow at 3.6 per cent per year between 1998 and 2008.34 In 2012, 67 per cent of Cambodian workers were employed, with an unemployment rate of 2.7 per cent.35 While a decade of rapid growth has notably improved the livelihoods of Cambodian people, with the headcount poverty rate falling from 50.1 per cent in 2007 to 20.5 per cent in 201136, there is more work to be done to ensure decent and quality employment for Cambodia's working population, to viably and sustainably reduce poverty.

  4.1 Employment by sector in Cambodia In 2013, agricultural, forestry and fishing workers accounted for the largest share of the total employed population at 62.9 per cent, followed by 11.9 per cent employed as services and sales workers and 10.1 per cent as craft and related workers (Graph 2).37 Women workers outnumbered men workers in these three largest work sectors, whereas men dominated in the remaining sectors (elementary occupations, professionals, clerical support workers, plant and machine operators, and managers).38 This data reinforces the link between education and better employment; women's participation in secondary education is lower than men's (32.1 per cent of Cambodian men had attended secondary school in 2012, as opposed to 23.9 per cent of women39). Women are therefore more limited in opportunities to enter semi professional occupations that remain male-dominated and better paid. This is a push factor for low-skilled women workers to migrate, as they can receive better wages in their lower skilled professions overseas.

Graph 2: Total employed population in Cambodia by sector in 2013

 

 

4.2 Informal employment in Cambodia In 2012, an estimated 81.2 per cent (5.9 million people) of the 7.2 million employed people aged over 15 in Cambodia, worked in an informal sector enterprise, while 17.7 per cent (1.3 million people) worked in a formal sector enterprise.40 Employment of men and women in the informal sector was fairly even with women employed in 49.5 per cent of jobs. Men hold a larger proportion of formal sector jobs at 69.9 per cent.41

  The informal sector and informal employment continue to be vulnerable, with workers unlikely to have access to benefits or social protection programmes, and predominately low wages more at risk to the effects of economic cycles. The extent of the informal sector is a good labour market performance indicator, signalling the underutilization of the labour supply in Cambodia, and another push factor for people migrating overseas for work.

4.3 Unemployment The extent of unemployment in a country reflects the efficiency and effectiveness of an economy to absorb its labour force, and of the performance of the labour market. By a broad definition of unemployment, 42 the estimated unemployment rate43 in 2012 was 2.7 per cent for both men and women, with more urban-based people unemployed at 3 per cent, and rural-based people at 2.6 per cent.44 In Cambodia around two per cent of employed people were found in time-related underemployment,45 with 2.5 per cent of this population male, and 1.6 per cent female.

The youth (aged 15-24) unemployment rate in 2012 was 3.8 per cent (two per cent men, 1.8 per cent women), with the highest unemployment rate found among those aged 20-24 years at 4.5 per cent (4.8 per cent for men, 4.1 per cent for women). In 2012, Cambodian youth comprised 63 per cent of the total labour force. In order to absorb new job seekers in the labour force, the Government will need to diversify its economic base, boost the level of economic growth, and promote domestic and foreign investment. Achieving this will require enhancing productive work in existing economic activities and adequately training young workers for employment in emerging sectors.

4.4 ASEAN Economic Community 2015 With AEC coming into effect in 2015, regional integration will enable more mobility of skilled professionals. The main tools for facilitating labour mobility under the AEC are the MRAs. MRAs establish the skills or experience relevant professionals need to gain certification and ultimately, to work abroad. However, seven of the eight occupations currently covered by MRAs (engineers, nurses, architects, land surveyors, medical and dental practitioners, and accountants), constitute just one per cent of total employment in Cambodia.46 Moreover, any mobility of professional workers will disproportionately benefit men, given that men are represented in far higher numbers within these occupations. Women's equal access to employment must be addressed in order to ensure that they are able to benefit from AEC.

After the establishment of AEC, the demand for low- or medium-skilled migrant workers will persist, and may actually increase, as can be seen in Graph 3, which considers the case of Thailand.

42 Under international standards, the strict definition of unemployment includes those who were searching and were available for work. A broad definition also includes those who wanted to work.

43 Defined as the unemployed as a percentage of the labour force. 44Ministry of Planning, National Institute of Statistics; International Labour Organization. 2013. Cambodia Labour Force and Child Labour Survey 2012: Labour Force Report. Phnom Penh: ILO.

45 The criteria for defining time-related underemployment is: (i) willingness to work additional hours; ii) availability to work additional hours and (iii) having worked (total number of hours actually worked) below a threshold of working hours.

46 International Labour Organisation and Asian Development Bank, 2014. ASEAN community 2015: Managing integration for better jobs and shared prosperity. Bangkok, Thailand: ILO and ADB.

  Thailand's ageing population and falling fertility rates will contribute to labour shortages which are expected to create a shortfall of some 4.7 million workers by 2020.47 Correspondingly, the demand for migrant workers is projected to increase over this period, with the greatest demand being for low- and medium-skilled workers. Given the overrepresentation of women migrant workers in low-skilled positions, Cambodian women should be supported through this policy to achieve the economic advantages offered by increased demand.

Graph 3: Projected demand for migrant workers in Thailand, 2012-21 (millions) 48

As most of Cambodia's migrant workers are low- or medium-skilled, current measures for the freer mobility of high-skilled workers are likely to have limited impact in the short term. Between 2015 and 2025, demand is likely to increase rapidly for some skills in the region, and decrease for others. Growth in low-skilled employment will probably remain strong however in Cambodia, highlighting the continued importance of ensuring quality standards in basic education and training, and a focus on skills recognition, social protection and safeguarding the rights of migrant workers.

4.5 Skills development and recognition The Cambodia Qualifications Framework (CQF) has been devised, and there has been steady progress with the development of competency standards and new technical and vocational qualifications. However, the overall architecture of a functioning technical and vocational education and training (TVET) system is still in development. At the same time, the ILO "Towards a Mutual Recognition of Skills (MRS) in Cambodia, Lao PDR and Myanmar" Project aims to assist in navigating these three countries in the design and implementation of the mutual recognition of skills mechanisms through policy guidelines and directions. By doing so, Cambodia will be able to gradually and equitably integrate into the AEC and, in turn, enjoy the benefits. The project goal is that by March 2015, two skills or competency standards in two occupations are agreed, developed and adapted in Cambodia through tripartite consultation,

  and that appropriate competency-based curriculum and learning materials are developed.49

An ADB Project is also working to support the Government's socio-economic development programme through provision of an industry-endorsed TVET system (using a Competency Based Training model) aligned with the basic and middle-level skill requirements of the formal and informal economies in three industry sectors: mechanics, construction, and business services / information and communications technology (ICT). The project is expected to increase the employment-ready and qualified middle-level workforce both in rural and urban areas. It is expected that there will be at least a 30 per cent increase in the number of employees holding formal industry endorsed TVET qualifications, and greater employer satisfaction with employees holding new formal TVET qualifications.50

In addition, a modality is required to assess and recognize the skills of returning migrant workers so they can find decent jobs in Cambodia and contribute more fully to national development. This requires the setting up of a national assessment centre, which is also required for full implementation of the CQF. A benchmarking exercise was also requested so that the CQF may be compared with the frameworks in other ASEAN countries to ensure complementarity and mutual skills recognition.

5. Evaluation of the Policy on Labour Migration for Cambodia 2010-2015

In June 2010, the MOLVT launched its first Policy on Labour Migration for Cambodia for 2010-2015. The policy and accompanying action plan were prepared through a series of consultative workshops with concerned government agencies, workers' and employers' organizations, international agencies, NGOs and community based organisations (CBOs) in Cambodia. The policy articulated the main policy challenges for the Royal Government of Cambodia, and outlined three main objectives which are still relevant in 2015; better governance of labour migration; protection and empowerment of migrant workers; and harnessing the potential of labour migration for development. The policy action plan activities were identified as short term (1-2 years) or medium term (3-5 years), and identified responsible stakeholders in the realization of these goals.

In 2014, at the first consultation to assess the implementation of the 2010-2015 Policy and to gather input to support the development of the 2015-2018 Policy, stakeholders used a system devised by UN Women, to determine if activities from the 2010-2015 Policy on were on target, progressing, or not on target.

  progressing, and 35.5 per cent were not on target (Graph 4). Of the activities that are on target and progressing, most are undertaken with the support of international organizations and NGOs, and funded by the donor community, with notable contributions from USAID, DFAT, SDC and UN agencies, and numerous civil society organisations that conduct safe migration training.

In terms of the three objectives identified in the Policy, more progress has been seen under 'Governance of Labour Migration' and the 'Protection and Empowerment of Migrant Workers', than under 'Harnessing Labour Migration for Development' (Graph 4). As such, implementation of the Labour Migration Policy for Cambodia 2015-2018 will focus more around harnessing the development potential of labour migration, as much progress has been made on legislative development over the last five years.

Graph 4: Progress of activities against the Policy on Labour Migration for Cambodia for 2010-2015

Some of the gaps in the implementation of the Action Plan may be due to a lack of ownership beyond the MOLVT and a lack of monitoring and evaluation. After its adoption, there was limited discussion with stakeholders outside the MOLVT on the Policy and action plan. It is also clear that the Government, international organizations and donors have put a priority on combatting exploitation and human trafficking, and therefore there was more support available to MOLVT and others in conducting activities aimed to address the protection of migrant workers. Across the countries of origin in ASEAN, with the exception of the Philippines, there are few examples of policies and programmes to support the return and reintegration of migrant workers. It is also important to recognize the limited human and financial resources of the MOLVT to address all aspects of the plan. Recognizing that some issues in labour migration management lie outside the mandate of the MOLVT, success of the Labour Migration Policy for Cambodia 2015-2018 will rely on increased and continued cooperation amongst government departments, and with social partners in Cambodia.

 

6. Objectives of the Labour Migration Policy for Cambodia 2015-2018

Significant progress has been made in recent years on legal and policy framework governing labour migration, and measures to protect migrant workers, this continues to be a priority for the Royal Government of Cambodia. However, more can be done to enhance the development impact of labour migration. This requires enabling safe migration into decent work, as well as efforts to address the reintegration of migrant workers, the productive use of remittances and greater engagement with diaspora and returned migrants. These initiatives must be evidence-based, drawing on sex-disaggregated data collection to measure the positive use of remittances, the link between skills acquisition and earning potential, and the link between migration and poverty reduction.

More broadly, this Policy recognizes the need to simultaneously promote quality domestic employment and skills development for workers into emerging sectors, as well as streamlining labour migration into national employment and development plans. The in-development National Employment Policy includes supporting the mobility of workers and protection of migrant workers under the goal of enhancing labour market governance, as well as putting employment generation (quantity and quality) at the heart of economic and social policy-making. Labour migration is also included in the National Strategic Development Plan 2014-2018, framing emigration as a potential tool to strengthen Cambodia's human resources, and the Rectangular Strategy Phase III 2013-2018, demonstrating a Government commitment to promote employment and institute a policy framework so that productive employment generation and economic development occur in tandem.

One of the areas for improvement identified in the Policy on Labour Migration for Cambodia for 2010-2015 was systematic monitoring and evaluation by an oversight body. In consultations for the Labour Migration Policy 2015-18, the Government discussed establishing a Sub-Committee on Labour Migration, with tripartite representation, under the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Examining and Preparing the National Employment Policy chaired by MOLVT that will annually review progress and identify priorities for the upcoming year. At the inaugural meeting of this Sub-Committee, clear operational responsibilities, indicators of progress and means of verification (using data from different Government departments, social partners and CSOs) would need to be outlined for the MOLVT, MOI, MOFA&IC and MOWA on the implementation of this Policy. The activities in the Action Plan have been framed in a way to allow for simpler verification and reporting of progress.

Overall policy objective: To develop a comprehensive and effective labour migration governance framework that protects and empowers women and men throughout the migration cycle, ensures that migration is an informed choice, and enables a positive and profitable experience for individual workers, their families and communities, that also contributes to the development of Cambodia. Recognizing and responding to the distinct needs of migrant workers with respect to their gender, sector, legal status and other individual characteristics, is central to the Policy and its effective implementation.

To achieve this overall policy objective, there are three specific objectives; (1) formulation and implementation of rights-based and gender-sensitive policy and legislation through social dialogue at all levels; (2) protection and empowerment of men and women migrant

  labour migration and mobility to enhance social and economic development in Cambodia recognising that migrant workers are agents of innovation and development.

Section 7 Policy Matrix: Strategic areas, policy goals and action plan sets out the three specific objectives, areas of implementation, policy goals, and activities to achieve them, responsible government stakeholders and timeframe to achieve these activities.

Figure 1: Labour Migration Policy for Cambodia Flowchart

The following sections 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 outline the policy goals under the Policy's 3 specific objectives. The action points to achieve these policy goals can be found in Section 7 Policy Matrix: Strategic areas, policy goals and action plan.

6.1 Governance of labour migration Since 2011, the MOLVT has initiated a number legislative instruments to strengthen labour migration governance. These have set up a framework for regulating recruitment practices, protecting migrant workers and facilitating regular migration. Bilaterally, there has also been cooperation with the Royal Government of Thailand on the regularisation of irregular migrant workers. In 2014, the Government responded quickly to the exodus of Cambodian migrant workers from Thailand by providing employment services, proposing provincial passport offices and lowering the cost of passports - although the effectiveness of these services was undermined by the swift return of migrants to Thailand. Following the suspension on sending domestic workers to Malaysia, several drafts of a MOU with Malaysia have been reviewed with the goal of reopening this corridor.

It is acknowledged that labour migration is an issue inter-connected with a range of other policies involving other ministries and stakeholders, and more dialogue and cooperation is needed to meaningfully implement and enforce protection mechanisms for migrant workers.

6.1.1 Key policy areas in migration governance Governance of labour migration is divided into three areas of implementation: international framework, legislative / regulatory framework and institutional framework.

Areas of Implementation

Policy Goals

Activities

3 Specific Objectives

  International framework Policy goal 1: International standards and instruments related to labour migration and migrant workers are reviewed with respect to the Cambodian context and legal framework, and ratified and implemented in a gender-sensitive manner.

Policy goal 2: The Government contributes to multilateral and regional cooperation on labour migration, particularly within ASEAN, with a clear vision of how ASEAN regional integration and the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) can enhance decent work opportunities for all migrant workers.

Policy goal 3: In consultation with social partners and civil society organizations, the Government establishes gender-sensitive, sector specific minimum standards for MOUs with destination countries as a condition of sending, and key articles for contracts with employers prior to sending any workers abroad.

Institutional Framework Policy goal 4: The MOLVT invests in the capacity of the relevant bodies at central and provincial levels, and takes a leadership role in strengthening inter-ministerial cooperation on labour migration, including actively contributing to the Migration Working Group of the National Committee to Counter Human Trafficking.

Legislative/regulatory framework Policy goal 5: New legislation and regulations are considered only where gaps are identified, and developed to reflect the specific and distinct needs of women and men migrants through tripartite consultation. Procedures related to labour migration are streamlined to incentivise regular migration and protect workers' rights.

Policy goal 6: Sex-disaggregated data is collected and analysed on a regular basis to inform evidence-based policy that is tailored to and addresses the experiences of women and men migrant workers.

6.2 Protection and empowerment of women and men migrant workers Since 2011, the MOLVT has given significant attention to increasing the protection of migrant workers prior to departure. Prakas No. 47 ensures that private recruitment agencies must satisfy a range of minimum requirements in order to obtain a license, with prakas No. 250 and 251 instituting regular monitoring processes for private recruitment agencies, and suspending their license if they fail to comply. Currently, MOLVT is formulating checklists to outline more specific criteria for inspections of recruitment agencies.

Sub-decree 190, prakas No. 46, and the effective delivery of MOLVT national standardised PreDeparture Orientation materials, can ensure that each migrant worker is informed of their rights at work and workplace practices, culture and tradition in destination countries, financial literacy, health awareness, and how to access rights both at home and abroad. The prakas ensures that trainers from recruitment agencies must be certified, and that migrant workers receive a pre-departure orientation certificate as proof of completion as a pre- requisite to migration. The MOLVT has conducted training-of-trainers for pre-departure training, and will monitor its quality and assess its effectiveness.

In January 2014, the MOLVT opened a Migrant Worker Resource Centre (MRC) at the Department of Employment and Manpower in Phnom Penh. Amongst its other functions, this

  MRC receives migrant worker grievances as per the complaints mechanism outlined in prakas No. 249. Complaints received to date relate to conditions prior to departure (for example, costs or delays in deployment) or while abroad (for example, pay or work conditions). In the coming years, institutional capacity will be built for migrant workers to lodge complaints through any PDOLVTs and have conciliation meetings held at the provincial level. Given reports of abusive, exploitative, fraudulent practices, or breaches of contracts held by Cambodian migrant workers, it is timely that in November 2014 the MOLVT is formulating a prakas on use of private recruitment agencies guarantee deposit as a mechanism to be able to compensate victims.

Whilst prakas No. 252 outlines private recruitment agencies' responsibilities to migrant workers in destination countries, more work is needed to ensure the protection of migrant workers abroad. The Government has not yet appointed labour attachés in key destination countries, although MOLVT is in the process of deploying a labour councillor to the Republic of Korea. The consular mandate needs to include vetting employers and working conditions before allowing migrant workers to be recruited, and working closely with authorities and other service providers to ensure the protection of Cambodian nationals.

6.2.1 Key policy areas in protection and empowerment of migrant workers Protection and empowerment of migrant workers is divided into two areas of implementation: supervision of recruitment and placement, and support services.

Supervision of recruitment and placement Policy goal 7: The Government monitors and enforces protection mechanisms in the recruitment and placement of migrant workers, including institutionalising inspection of private recruitment agencies, the delivery of pre-departure training, and regulating the costs of migration, including brokerage fees.

Policy goal 8: Unlicensed brokers or agents, or licensed recruitment agencies linked to exploitative or unscrupulous practices, are targeted with appropriate sanctions to reduce irregular migration and reduce the vulnerability of migrant workers.

Support Services Policy goal 9: Government consular services are established or enhanced in major destination countries to provide effective assistance to men and women migrant workers regardless of their status, including shelter, legal, labour dispute, social protection and repatriation facilities.

Policy goal 10: Migrants' access to justice is facilitated through implementing the complaints mechanism in an effective, gender-sensitive and timely manner. In the event of a crime, judicial processes are initiated to ensure an adequate penalty, and a deterrent to others.

Policy goal 11: The Government facilitates migrants' access to vocational training programs to develop and recognize the skills of migrant workers as a measure to enhance protection and earning potential. Training programmes and skills recognition systems are developed for women and men in consultation with employers and governments of destination countries, according to labour market needs, in specific occupations and sectors.

  Policy goal 12: The Government cooperates with local leaders, social partners and civil society organizations to provide accurate and up-to-date information on safe migration and rights at work in major migrant-sending communities and in transit hubs.

Policy goal 13: Feasibility studies are conducted by the Government on further protection mechanisms for men and women migrant workers such as the revolving credit and loan funds, and migrant welfare funds to assist men and women migrant workers with migration.

6.3 Harnessing labour migration for development Since 2010, inclusion of international labour migration policy into national development and employment plans has increased, as has acknowledged that domestic policy needs to cater to the large young working age population.

The National Strategic Development Plan 2014-2018, categorises emigration as an issue for the National Committee for Population and Development (NCPD) to work on in association with other line ministries and agencies, to strengthen its human resources for integrating population-related issues into the development planning processes at all levels for planners and policy makers. The in-development National Employment Policy aims to put employment generation (quantity and quality) at the heart of economic and social policy- making, focusing on young women and men and considering labour migration amongst other aspects. The National Policy of Cambodian Youth Development in association with the National Youth Action Plan 2014- 2018, seeks to provide alternatives to migration, while the Millennium Development Goals Acceleration Process includes providing employment and training services as alternatives to migration and options for returning migrants. The Rectangular Strategy Phase III 2013-2018 demonstrates a strong Government commitment to promoting employment as a central part of their medium-term development strategy and institute a policy framework such that productive employment generation and economic development occur in tandem.

These policies and initiatives, however, have yet to be transformed into operational programmes and services that either provide adequate alternatives to migration for certain parts of the population, enhance the development impact of migration, or that will benefit returning migrant workers in their economic and social reintegration.

6.3.1 Key policy areas in migration and development Harnessing labour migration for development is divided into three areas of implementation: migration in the National Development Agenda, migrants' remittances and investments, and return and reintegration.

Migration in the National Development Agenda Policy goal 14: Labour migration continues to be included within national development and sectorial plans to recognize and maximise the development potential of migration for Cambodia, and ensure coherent development planning.

Migrants' remittances and investments Policy goal 15: The Government works with financial institutions in Cambodia and destination countries to enable access to safe, efficient and cheaper remittance and financial services for migrant workers. The impact of remittances on development is enhanced through support services provided to migrants and their families, including gender-sensitive financial literacy training, a broader range of financial services and products, and dialogue and tools for

  diaspora engagement.

Return and Reintegration Policy goal 16: Productive return and reintegration of women and men migrant workers is enabled through evidence-based policy, and strengthened service provision for social and economic reintegration, including employment services, skills development and recognition, enterprise development training, and investment programmes.

Policy goal 17: The social cost of migration is mitigated through specific programmes, including through the provision of support to the families and children of migrant workers.
