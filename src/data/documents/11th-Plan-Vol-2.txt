HIS MAJESTY THE KING JIGME KHESAR NAMGYEL WANGCHUCK

Our Nation has seen great socio-economic growth but it is more important that we have growth with equity. We must raise, with all our effort, the less fortunate so that they may, at the earliest, begin to partake in the opportunities brought by modernization and progress.

The government has provided education to our youth. But for the nation to prosper for all time, a sound education must be succeeded by access to the right jobs and responsibilities, so that our youth may bloom as individuals and at the same time serve their Nation well.

The recent Rupee shortage is a serious problem. I feel it is a reminder that, as a Nation, we must exercise our traditional sense of caution and work even harder as we address the challenges of the time. For no matter what challenges lie ahead, it is only the Bhutanese citizen who can protect and safeguard Bhutan.

- His Majesty The King's address to the nation during the 105th National Day celebrations, 17th December 2012, in Thimphu.

RENEWABLE NATURAL RESOURCES

Au Name: MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE AND FORESTS Department: DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE

Program Name: National Field Crop Commodity Development Program Phase: Approved

Justification: Domestic production of cereals meets only66% of the total requirement. Country is only 47% self-sufficient in rice,47% in wheat, 40% is pulses and less than10% in oils. However, the country has the potential to increase both production and productivity. Agriculture is important not only to the rural farming households. It contributes significantly to national economy by employing more than 60% of the country's population. It also provides important ecological functions and contributes significantly in carbon sequestration. It is also the living tradition and culture and hence plays very important role in cultural preservation. Some of the major challenges to agriculture growth include lack of assured irrigation water, predation of crops by wild animals, labour shortages and agriculture feminization resulting into low level of agriculture intensity. Steep terrain and dispersed settlements are some of the physical challenges affecting growth.

Strategy: i. To bring focus on priority commodities to enhance production, commodity program approach will be continued with specific commodity area delineation. ii. Commercialization for potential crops such as rice, maize, wheat and oil seeds will be pursued through PPP/IFD. iii. To achieve the volume for commercialization, land intensification will be emphasized through assured irrigation water and mechanization services. iv. At strategic locations, storage facilities and processing plants will beinstituted. v. Environmentally friendly and socially accepted electric fencing system (EFS) will be promoted, and SLM technologies will be promoted in steep slopes. vi. Research on varieties that are tolerant to biotic and abiotic stress to cope with climate change challenges will be pursued strongly.

Risk Assessment: i. Inadequate and timely allocation of fund ii. Loss of agriculture land to soil erosion, landslide, flash flood and infrastructures development. iii. The climate change impact such as extreme weather condition can perpetuate drought, flood and outbreak of pest and diseases. iv. Cheap import opportunities of cereal grains and other field crops from across the border may also limit participation of private sector.

Beneficiary: i. At the national level, the successful implementation of the program will reduce dependence on import of cereal, pulses and oil and improve food security and sufficiency levels. ii. At the local level, the program will benefit the farming households by creating meaningful and gainful employment opportunities.

Program Name: National Horticulture Commodity Development Program Phase: Approved

Justification: The demand for horticultural crops to meet nutrition, food and income requirement is growing to keep up with increasing population, urbanization and disposable incomes. The domestic production especially vegetables is increasingly falling behind in meeting the domestic demand. This is resulting in growing importation of these products and corresponding trade imbalances. This program plans to revert this trend by strengthening the commodity chains of (i) vegetables, (ii) citrus, (iii) potato, (iv) fruits & nuts, (v) medicinal, aromatic & spice and (vi) mushrooms with greater emphasis on increasing production for meeting domestic requirement and enhancing income through internal trade and export. This would require the design of interventions that will not only increase productivity but also expanding area under cultivation and improving product handling/processing across the entire chain. Such interventions will necessarily involve systematic widening of all technical, institutional & policy bottlenecks which prevent farmers from engaging in increasing productivity.

Strategy: i. National horticultural commodity development program will be implemented by the Dzongkhag & Geog administration with support from different central programs viz. Research & Development Centres, Engineering Division, National Plant Protection Centre, National Soil Service Centre, National Mushroom Centre, Agriculture Machinery Centre, National Seed Centre, National Post harvest Centre and National Organic Program. The overall coordination of commodity programs will be carried out by the commodity coordinators based in Horticulture Division. The program will adopt a strategy which is aimed at improving the national self-sufficiency, especially vegetables by the end of the 11th FYP. ii. The programs will focus on key measures aimed at increasing the farm productivity, competitiveness and output of the targeted crop value chains to contribute to enhanced national food and nutrition security.

Risk Assessment: i. Climate change risk (extreme weather conditions; pest and disease epidemics, break down of crop resistance) ii. Funding risks (Inadequate RGoB funding support, limited donor projects) iii. Human Resource Risk (Inadequate numbers of technically competent professionals) iv. Private engagement risk (Lack of cooperation and interest from private agencies/individuals, unwillingness to invest in RNR commodity programs - PPP models) v. Market related risks: (demand and supply not matching, limited market access)

Beneficiary: i. Farming communities; ii. Private entrepreneurs engaged in horticulture crop production and marketing.

Program Name: Agriculture Infrastructure Development Phase: Approved

Justification: The basic infrastructure required to enhance the production of cereals and horticulture crops is adequate irrigation facilities to meet the crop water requirements. The country has a large network of irrigation systems designed primarily to meet water demand for paddy cultivation. However, owing to inadequate maintenance, use of inappropriate technology and technical design, most of these irrigation systems have low water delivery efficiency. These problems have resulted in low crop yields. Irrigation infrastructures for Kamzhing are virtually non- existent. This land use type constitutes a major part of the total arable land and now supports important commercial crops such as potato, fruit crops, maize and vegetables. Therefore, continued investment in irrigation infrastructure will be required to enhance productivity and production of agricultural crops. The importance of farm roads requires no emphasis as still about 31% of the rural population still reside one hour walking distance from road head.

Strategy: i. The Department of Agriculture will plan and implement all major new and rehabilitation projects. Detailed design of the systems will be carried out by the Engineering Division while actual construction will be outsourced to local contractors. ii. DoA will also implement storage, pumping and water management research programs in collaboration with relevant agencies. iii. In collaboration with Horticulture Division, potential areas for irrigating commercial crops will be identified and appropriate irrigation technologies will be developed. iv. To keep abreast of new technologies and enhance knowledge and skills of DoA engineers, a select number of farm road construction and its improvement will also be implemented. v. The program will also initiate land development activities in selected Dzongkhags.

Risk Assessment: i. Risk of not getting the required minimum additional engineers especially at the RDCs. ii. Availability of adequate and timely fund.

Beneficiary: i. The direct beneficiaries of irrigation program will be the farmers owning Chuzhing and those cultivating commercial crops such as potato, orchards, vegetables etc. ii. Land development will benefit dry land and orchard owners. iii. Farm roads will benefit rural communities, traders and facilitate civil servants and other development organizations in their field activities.

Program Name: National Organic Development Programme (NOP). Phase: Approved

Justification: Organic farming in Bhutan is still in its infancy but there is growing interest from both the Government and the farming communities in developing this potential in Bhutan. This is because organic food is increasingly gaining popularity in mainstream agriculture around the world with growing global market. It therefore presents significant prospects for commercial agriculture as well as for promoting sustainable agriculture practices. Organic farming is known to help improve soil conditions and land use management for small farms. It can also provide for broader income base through diversification of crops. Further, processing and marketing of organic agricultural products could also create new off-farm rural employment opportunities, especially when export markets can be accessed effectively. Therefore, given the expected economic and environmental benefits, this program will continue to promote and strengthen enabling policy environment for the development of organic farming in Bhutan.

Strategy: i. Category 1 - Naturally organic - will be implemented in remote areas, areas within National Parks and high altitude areas with the objective of conserving watershed, household food and nutrition security and developing integrated self-reliant farming systems. ii. Category 2 - will focus on selected areas on selected products linked to potential markets. Production for local markets by farmer groups will be organized to supply local markets with local organic guarantee with Bhutan organic logo for domestic market iii. Category 3 - Any area suitable for production, any products identified as suitable for production for assured market with certification and for exports.

Risk Assessment: i. Having a National Organic Policy will determine the development of organic sector in the future. ii. Priority and vision of the government towards organic sector will have direct bearing on the implementation of the planned activities. iii. Availability and timely allocation of resources will directly affect the program objectives. iv. Coordination within and among the line agencies including private sector will affect market growth

Beneficiary: i. Organic RNR sector ii. Small farm holders and commercial organic farmers iii. Organic traders iv. General consumers v. Country- environmental conservation

Program Name: National Livestock Commodity Development Programme Phase: Approved

Justification: Livestock production in Bhutan mainly includes dairy products, meat, fish and poultry products. Over the years, livestock sector witnessed significant progress and has contributed significantly to food and nutrition security of the populace. However, owing to several constraints and challenges, livestock sector has not grown rapidly as it could. A large share of national consumption of livestock products are still imported. Latest RNR statistics of 2012 suggest that about 80% of national domestic beef consumption requirements are still imported. Similarly, about 97% of total fish consumption and 83% of total pork consumption are all met from imports. There is thus considerable potential for expanding livestock production beyond subsistence levels in view of the sizeable demand within the domestic market, particularly in the major urban centers. Therefore, in consideration of the huge potential of the sector to enhance the income generation capacity as well as improving the food and nutrition security status of the population, the program will continue to focus on creating an enabling environment to boost livestock production.

Strategy: i. Institute and strengthen national commodity & service Centers and implement commodity development plans. ii. Pursue pro-poor livestock development initiatives iii. Conduct value chain analysis of livestock commodities iv. Encourage investments in commercial livestock farming v. Explore possibilities of horizontal and vertical integration of mega farms to small producers vi. Institute improved services delivery system vii. Encourage and foster formation of groups/cooperatives viii. Standardize technology transfer process ix. Pursue Public-Private Partnership (PPP) including FDI for all commodities- x. Improve animal energy resources for draft power

Risk Assessment: i. Inadequate budget allocation can hamper the implementation of planned activities, ii. Unavailability of skilled human resources can be a bottle- neck iii. Limited access to livestock inputs depending on import, iv. Unaffordable and low quality feed v. Limited land holding for livestock enterprises

Beneficiary: i. Rural and urban livestockfarmers of Bhutan. ii. Entrepreneurs engaged in livestock sector. iii. Consumers

Program Name: Targeted Highland Development Programme Phase: Approved

Justification: Highlanders and the nomadic communities play an important role in maintaining the integrity of the northern frontiers. However, over the years, the population of the herders and nomads are reported to be on decline. This is because herding in extreme climatic conditions entails hard work with no commensurate gains. Many of these nomadic communities continue to rely on traditional methods which are highly inefficient, laborious and less productive. There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that the herding culture is increasingly becoming less attractive among the younger generations. If left unchecked, this continual decreasing trend will likely lead to the extinction of the nomadic culture and may likely compromise the integrity of the biodiversity resources in the high land areas. This program therefore will design and implement appropriate interventions that not only improves livelihoods of the high land communities but also promotes conservation of biodiversity and important watersheds.

Strategy: i. Institute a nodal agency to address the livestock priority needs of nomadic communities; ii. Promote efficient management of rangelands and watersheds; iii. Promote and support organic livestock production; iv. Promote use of alternative energy sources. v. Promote eco-tourism and niche product development.

Risk Assessment: i. Limited accessibility to provide coordinated supports. ii. Migration & alternative income sources iii. Acceptability of planned programs

Beneficiary: i. Highland communities

Au Name: MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE AND FORESTS Department: DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE MARKETING AND COOPERATIVES

Program Name: Agriculture Marketing & Cooperative Development Program Phase: Approved

Justification: Farming in Bhutan has largely remained subsistence although the sale of agriculture, livestock and forestry products continues to be a major source of income to many of the farmers. As an agrarian society where more than60% of population depend directly on farming, agriculture marketing can play a huge role in the growth and development of farming systems in Bhutan. Nonetheless, in-spite of continuous effort by the Government to making the agriculture marketing system efficient and vibrant, the development of agriculture marketing and trade is still faced with several challenges. Some of the main challenges are paucity of information on commodity prices, deep knowledge gap on demand-supply conditions and market outlet, minimal economy of scale , extremely weak coordination between the Department and other technical Departments, inadequate mechanism for product standardization, grading, packaging and labeling, lack of product differentiation and lack of processing and value addition.

Strategy: i. Department-wise commodity focal persons will be further strengthened in line with the Departments' priorities to cater to the Cooperatives and Marketing needs effectively. ii. Focus on the implementation of the commodity wise programs through the regulation and promotion of farmers groups and cooperatives. iii. The focus, going forward, will be on developing and facilitating linkages and networking between the major markets and the producers/dealers/ cooperatives. iv. Conduct strategic market research and studies to the production plan for the potential commercial products. v. Contact farming will continue to receive attention in the11th FYP and will be strengthened and up-scaled to other commodities and clients.

Risk Assessment: i. Market Size: small population and scattered households makes marketing challenging as demand is small coupled with limited scope of economy of scale in production, collection or distribution. ii. Competition with Indian produce/products iii. Ownership of new marketing interventions by farmers and traders

Beneficiary: i. Farmers ii. Traders/vendors/middlemen/entrepreneurs iii. Farmer groups and cooperatives

Program Name: RNR Research & Extension Services Program Phase: Approved

Justification: With the restructuring of the RNR research system in the 10th FYP, the administration and management of the Research and Development Centers were entrusted with the relevant technical Departments. The CoRRB secretariat was given the new mandated to screen RNR research proposals for relevance & quality control and monitor and evaluate research programs through reviews, impact studies and recommend changes and adjustments in RNR policies and programs. The generation of RNR technologies over the years has contributed to productivity enhancements of many agriculture commodities. However, in-spite of its progress, Bhutan continues to depend on India and other countries in meetings its demand for agriculture commodities. Any effort to boost domestic production is expected to increasingly exert pressure on natural resources and its carrying capacity. There is therefore, the need to constantly review, evaluate and make adjustments in generation of RNR technology to ensure that the technology generations are relevant to the emerging issues and challenges.

Strategy: i. Building up appropriate research agenda through consultation considering the One Gewog Three Products (OGTP), area/crop potential and marketability. ii. Conduct regular evaluation and impact studies and use these studies to recommend strategies & policies to enhance land expansion, market, irrigation, farm mechanization and consolidation of agriculture production areas, in the research agenda. Collate feedbacks from various stakeholders of MoAF to respond to various needs and challenges

Risk Assessment: i. Financial resources constraint ii. Limited research capability. iii. Adoption of technology by the farmers/entrepreneurs

Program Name: School Agriculture Program Phase: Approved

Justification: The School Agriculture Program (SAP) contributes to attaining the socio economic development goals of the Bhutan by-way empowering youths with sound entrepreneurial knowledge and skills in framing. With increasing need for nutritionally balanced food for the school youths and withdrawal of WFP feeding program by 2018, SAP will play an important role in contributing to the food and nutrition security of school students and help in maintaining the school enrollment, particularly in rural communities of Bhutan. In the recent survey done by Institute for Management Studies [IMS2010], 49% of the respondents reported that SAP offers a great opportunity in school feeding and nutrition, especially in schools with boarding facilities. Further, program will also prepare the school youths to take up farming on a commercial basis and will contribute to lowering the unemployment situation in the country.

Strategy: i. SAP will continue to focus on integrated agriculture which includes vegetable production, poultry rearing, dairy, piggery and fishery. ii. The program will use the experiences gained from the past to cover more schools under the program in the11th FYP. iii. The program will also continue to upscale the farm to school approach in the11th FYP. iv. With the view to sustaining the SAP, the program will, during the plan period, work towards including agriculture as one of the subject in the school curriculum.

Risk Assessment: i. Possible conflict with academic schedule and SAP receiving second priority. ii. Ownership of SAP by schools. iii. Inadequate fund to implement SAP

Beneficiary: i. SAP schools, ii. Educated youths engaged in farming. iii. Farmers

Program Name: Biodiversity Conservation Program Phase: Approved

Justification: Although the country's natural environment is relatively pristine, the globally significant genetic diversity (both plant and animal) of Bhutan is under increasing threat. Introduction of new crop and animal genetic varieties with the aim of boosting farm production is expected to adversely impact the local genetic resources in the long-run. Further, management of newly introduced varieties invariably necessitates new agronomic approaches which would gradually lead to the erosion of the age old traditional knowledge and culture associated with biological resources. It will therefore be in the interest of Bhutan to conserve traditional genetic materials for national food security and resilience to climate change. Additionally, tapping the potential of biodiversity resources to enhance sustainable livelihood would be an effective means of linking environment to development. This would require putting in place appropriate legal frameworks and institutional capacity to ensure its sustainable use

Strategy: i. Implement ex-situ conservation activities in collaboration with other agencies. ii. Coordinate in situ conservation of domestic biodiversity in collaboration with farmers, local communities and other stakeholders. iii. Implement sustainable use program from bio-prospecting and other related perspectives in collaboration with other relevant agencies. iv. Strengthen biodiversity information and access to it in collaboration with relevant stakeholders. v. Up-grade the center to Directorate to strengthen institutional capacity for effective delivery of the mandates.

Risk Assessment: i. Inadequate human resource and technical expertise. ii. Inadequate support from collaborators. iii. Lack of policy support/policy change

Beneficiary: i. Farmers. ii. Private sector and business establishment. iii. Conservationists.

Program Name: National Biosecurity and Food Safety Programme Phase: Approved

Justification: Bhutan has a rich and varied biological diversity of regional and global importance that can be matched by few countries in the world. However, in the process of modernizing the Bhutanese economy and with ever increasing exchange of biological materials through trade, the status of Bhutan's biodiversity wealth are increasingly at risk from new pest and diseases. Be this as it may, Bhutan's capacity to effectively manage bio-security issues are relatively under developed. Further, as with many developing countries, food safety issues in the country are on the rise. An inefficient response to this issue will not only have negative affect on the health of the population but will also negatively impact the growth of tourism sector in Bhutan. Concurrently, the institutional capacity to manage food safety issues in Bhutan is also very weak.

Strategy: i. Strengthen capacity in risk assessment and management as a foundation of bio-security and food safety measures. ii. Strengthen regulatory and analytical capacity through upgrading scope of laboratory analyses. iii. Infrastructure development in strategic locations/entry points to optimize efficiency of bio-security measures. iv. Create mass awareness on roles and stakes of the public in bio-security and food safety activities through educational activities, awareness programmes and certification processes. v. Draft/review legislations/standards related to bio-security and food safety

Risk Assessment: i. Unavailability of land for construction of quarantine station, biological pits and offices. ii. Shortage of skilled human resource. iii. Inadequate funds for containment operation of random incidences of pest and disease epidemics. iv. Stakeholder resistance to bio-security and food safety regulatory measures.

Beneficiary: i. Government institutions/agencies. ii. General public. iii. Importers, exporters, farmers. iv. Business operators.

Program Name: Rural Development Training Programme Phase: Approved

Justification: Farming provides huge prospect for income generation and employment. Rising domestic food demand & increasing import of agriculture commodities has increased the opportunity for rural youth to engage in farming. Besides, it is also a priority of the Government to transform farming into a commercial venture. RDTC therefore, sees huge opportunity in specialized vocational training aimed at enhancing the capacity the farmers and youth to effectively manage farming enterprises. Besides, with the registration of farmers groups and cooperatives increasing every year, the demand for specialized training has increased rapidly. Addressing the capacity gaps of the farmers to manage their farms on a business model would contribute to positioning the subsistence farming system on a more commercial footing.

Strategy: i. The RDTC will engage with relevant clients in the formulation of training needs and training plans. ii. Long duration training that require special facilities will be conducted at the RDT center while short and management level training will be conducted at decentralized locations across the country to facilitate maximum participation, especially the women participants. iii. The center will attempt to make farming attractive by means of diversification, mechanization and providing decentralized training, creating interface between financer, promoter and youth.

Risk Assessment: i. Strong urban pull for the rural youths means the targeted population of the programme may not be available as planned. ii. Availability of adequate fund on time

Beneficiary: i. Rural Youth; ii. Farmer's group and cooperative's office bearers; iii. School students and focal agriculture teachers;

Program Name: Construction and Up-gradation of Southern East-West Highway Phase: Draft

Justification: Recognizing roads as the main economic lifeline, the Government has accorded the highest priority to the construction and improvement of primary and secondary national highways. To this end, the construction of 743 km Southern East-West Highway (SEWH) began in 2011. The construction of some segments of the SEWH comprising of approximately 356 km (approx. 50% of the total length) could not be completed during the 10th FYP. This program will facilitate the construction of the remaining segments of the SEWH in the 11FYP. When completed, this highway will provide reliable and safe connective infrastructure for the Bhutanese commuting between the eastern and western Bhutan and vice-versa. The SEWH will also provide linkage to the regional highway network such as the Asian Highway Network.

Strategy: i. The Department will continue its role of design, supervision, quality control and coordination with the actual construction works contracted out to private sectors. ii. With a view to ensure the quality construction and to achieve economy of scale, importance will be given to mechanizing construction activities while continuing to implement environmentally friendly road construction techniques. iii. To incentivize the contractors to ensure quality of construction, the Department has initiated awarding construction plus maintenance contracts in the 10FYP. This strategy will be continued in the 11FYP.

Risk Assessment: i. Landslide and flash flood. ii. Cooperation from the communities.

Program Name: Up-gradation/Improvement of Northern East-West Highway Phase: Draft

Justification: Being landlocked, Bhutan is heavily dependent on the existing network of national highways as the main mode of internal transport. Therefore, safe, reliable and efficient road-network is crucial for promoting balanced regional development. The northern east-west highway is one of the oldest highways and have contributed significantly to facilitating the movement of people and goods from western to eastern region and vice-versa. The highway will continue to serve as the principal mode of internal transport for the people of northeastern, north central and north western part of Bhutan. Therefore, sustained investment will be required to not only help maintain the highway but also to meet the growing demand of larger and heavier transport. This program will continue to improve and upgrade the existing highway to facilitate free flow of the traffic, reduce travel time and improve safety of the travellers.

Strategy: i. DoR will continue its role of design, supervision, quality control and coordination with the actual construction works contracted to private sector. ii. To ensure the quality construction and to achieve economy of scale, importance will be given to mechanizing construction activities while continuing to implement environmentally friendly road construction techniques. iii.

Program Name: Construction and upgrada-tion/Improvement of roads connecting Hydro Power Projects Phase: Draft

Justification: While the national highway network has expanded, it is still limited in term of connectivity, coverage and ability to meet the growing demands of larger and heavier transport. Further, roads in Bhutan are generally narrow with sharp curves, steep gradient and therefore not suitable for heavy load lorries. In order to facilitate faster development of hydro power projects, it is essential to put in place better quality roads that not only supports increasing number of traffic volume but also enables transportation of heavier equipment and materials efficiently to these hydropower project sites. Towards this end, this program will support the construction of new roads required to connect the project sites and improve the overall quality of existing highways connecting hydro project sites to accommodate 30-70 ton trucks.

Strategy: i. DoR will continue its role to design, supervise, control quality and coordinate with the actual construction works contracted out to private sector. ii. To ensure the quality construction and to achieve economy of scale, importance will be given to mechanizing construction activities while continuing to implement environmentally friendly road construction techniques. iii. To incentivize the contractors to ensure quality of construction, DoR has initiated awarding construction plus maintenance contracts in the10FYP. This strategy will be continued in the11FYP.

Program Name: Construction and up gradation of Dzongkhag roads Phase: Draft

Justification: Most of the roads in Bhutan are built at a time when traffic volume and load factor was very low. Therefore, transportation on the existing highways are noted to be highly inefficient and lengthy. In order to reduce transportation cost and facilitate efficient movement of goods and services among and within the Dzongkhags, availability of good road network is very crucial. To this end, the construction of new Dzongkhag roads and, continuous improvement and maintenance of Dzongkhag roads has now become critical. This program will continue to support the implementation of the Dzongkhag roads by providing technical backstopping on survey and designing of the roads implemented by Dzongkhags.

Strategy: i. DoR will continue its role of design, supervision, quality control and coordination with the actual construction works mostly contracted out to contractors. ii. To ensure the quality construction and to achieve economy of scale, importance will be given to mechanizing construction activities while maintaining environmentally friendly road construction practices.

Program Name: Construction/Up gradation of North-South Highways Phase: Draft

Justification: For a landlocked country, a good network of road and bridges play a critical role in facilitating trade, reducing the high cost of transportation normally associated with mountainous countries and for delivery of socio-economic services particularly to scattered and far-off rural communities. The construction of the first national highway started in 1961. Today, Bhutan has about 9491 kilometers of various categories of roads. The north-south highways have served as an important means of transport for promoting trade between northern and southern part of Bhutan. These highways are also important for completing the national highway grid and serve as the main take-off point for many of the existing feeder and farm roads. However, many of the north-south highways are highly inefficient, lengthy and susceptible to blocks from natural calamities such as landslides and snowfall. Continued investment is therefore required to maintain, improve and construct new north-south highways.

Strategy: i. DoR will continue its role of design, supervision, quality control and coordination with the actual construction works mostly contracted out to contractors. ii. To ensure the quality construction and to achieve economy of scale, importance will be given to mechanizing construction activities while maintaining Environmentally Friendly Road Construction practices.

Program Name: Road Asset Management Phase: Draft

Justification: The primary focus of the 10FYP was on expansion of the road network to provide accessibility to remote settlements in the country. With the increased road network, it has become important to maintain the existing road networks, especially the national highways to uphold the past capital investments. Research in some countries have indicated that the capital investments made by road agencies to keep a road in good condition comprise of 10 percent of the total cost while 90 percent of the total cost on poor condition roads is borne by road users in the form of vehicle operating costs (VOC). It is therefore less expensive for road agencies to maintain roads as compared to the VOC costs borne by road users due to poor road conditions. Periodic maintenance and management of road and bridge infrastructure will form an important activity of the Department in the 11FYP.

Strategy: i. DoR will continue its role of design, supervision, quality control and coordination with the actual construction works contracted out to private sector. ii. To ensure the quality construction and to achieve economy of scale, importance will be given to mechanizing construction/maintenance activities while maintaining environmentally friendly road construction practices. iii. The Department will take up mitigation measures to prevent landslides along existing road network and will explore permanent solutions to problematic landslide areas like Rotpashong.

HUMAN SETTLEMENT AND HOUSING

Au Name: MINISTRY OF WORKS AND HUMAN SETTLEMENT Department: DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SETTLEMENT

Program Name: Enhancing human settlements in Bhutan Phase: Draft

Justification: The development of human settlement areas has been accorded priority over the years but efforts have remained mostly concentrated in urban centers. Increasingly, with the improvements in the living standard of the people, unprecedented developments are observed to be taking place outside urban areas as well. Unplanned infrastructure development in peri-urban and rural areas can adversely affect the ambience and beauty of the traditional settlements. Lack of proper coordination and planning also leads to wasteful use of resources. There is therefore an urgent need to approach any settlement development plans holistically so that it provides a coherent framework to improve the quality of life for all Bhu-tanese. This program will work towards meaningfully contributing to maintaining and enhancing the quality and diversity of country's natural environment and cultural heritage rather than allowing uncontrolled development.

Strategy: i. Legal framework for the spatial planning will be drafted jointly by the local officials and international expert with experience in spatial planning law. ii. Existing rules and regulations shall be reviewed to suit the changing needs. iii. The department will undertake settlement planning as an activity from the outset of development.

Risk Assessment: i. Cooperation from the stakeholders; ii. Lack of competent professionals; iii. Adequate and time availability of fund.

Beneficiary: Whole settlement of the country.

CONSTRUCTION

Au Name: MINISTRY OF WORKS AND HUMAN SETTLEMENT Department: CONSTRUCTION DEVELOPMENT BOARD

Program Name: Promotion and Strengthening of Construction Sector Phase: Approved

Justification: With increasing growth of the construction industry over the years, the role and the mandate of the CDB has also expanded to suit its relevance to the changing needs. The accelerated hydropower development plan designed to generate 10,000 MW by 2020 offers huge prospects for the construction sector. While the sector has made significant progress over the years, there are still many challenges and weaknesses that need to be addressed during the coming years. Low levels of mechanization, poor quality of work implemented, relatively lengthy construction period with frequent time over-runs, lack of professionalism among the contractors and shortage of qualified and skilled professionals are some of the major constraints hindering its growth. Therefore, with a view to making the construction industry a major source of employment and income for the Bhutanese, this program will work towards building an efficient and quality based construction industry in Bhutan.

Strategy: i. Strengthen regulations; accelerate the implementation of e-services to enhance the capacity of the construction industry. ii. Promote, stimulate and undertake research in the construction sector to adopt new technologies. iii. Restructure Construction Development Board into Construction Development Authority. iv. Encourage contractors to adopt the best construction practices and mechanization in the construction industry. v. Provide industry support through policy reforms.

Risk Assessment: i. Availability of adequate and technically qualified manpower. ii. Cooperation from the contractors.

Program Name: Engineering adaptation for disaster risk reduction Phase: Draft

Justification: As the rivers flow towards the southern foothills, the transition from mountainous areas to flat plains typically occurs and is accompanied by extensive flooding. On the other hand, due to erratic rainfall pattern and unusually heavier precipitation, flooding in northern Bhutan is becoming a regular phenomenon. Flash flood carrying sizeable amounts of boulders and debris causes substantial damage and loss of lives from time to time. With climate change and degradation of environment, such incidences are expected to increase in the coming years. Therefore, it is urgently important to minimize the impacts of floods on human safety, health and welfare by designing interventions aimed at managing the risk posed by flood and other natural disasters. To this end, this program will formulate and implement various policies and regulations related to engineering aspects adaption to natural hazards and create conducive environment for integrating the best engineering technologies.

Strategy: i. FEMD under DES will lead as the primary institution responsible for flood risk alleviation works to protect all communities under the threat of flood. ii. Scattered data on water resources will be consolidated on database which would be the basis for mathematical modeling and production of Flood Risk maps. iii. Flood management projects on major rivers will be implemented to ensure an integrated river basin management strategy, while the local governments will take up minor flood protection scheme. EARRD continue its work on capacity development, technology promotion, quality assurance and risk reduction.

Risk Assessment: i. Lack of appropriate data. ii. Risk of flooding during construction phase. iii. Availability of technically competent professionals

Program Name: Technical support for construction and maintenance of trail suspension bridges Phase: Draft

Justification: Over the past years, Government has made huge investment in the construction of highways, farm roads and bridges. However, there are still many rural communities who use mule tracks, traditionally used trails and suspension bridges as the principle means of communication. Enhancing accessibility through the development of appropriate connective infrastructure will therefore contribute immensely to the reduction of rural poverty in the 11th FYP. Further, many of the important traditional routes have connection to the age old culture and tradition of Bhutan.

Program Name: Technical support and management for infrastructure development and engineering services Phase: Draft

Justification: Over the last decade, Bhutan has experienced a very rapid pace of urbanization. Additionally, with current pace of rural-urban migration, urban populations are projected to rise significantly while on the contrary there will be fewer people living in the rural areas. With unprecedented influx of people to urban areas, the major urban centers have already started to experience the adverse effect of urbanization. Conversely, rural areas are starting to become empty, giving rise to problems such as farm labor shortages, feminization of agricultural labor force and declining agriculture production. Managing urban development efficiently and effectively to build and sustain a quality urban environment is thus very crucial. This program is formulated to promote urban infrastructure development in the most cost effective manner while ensuring high live-ability. Besides, as a means towards spreading development across the region, proper development of regional hubs will be implemented.

Strategy: i. Devise and implement urban development plans for regional growth centers and major towns in accordance with the National Spatial Planning Policy and National Urbanization Strategy. ii. Decentralize project implementation to the respective Municipalities/LGs with technical backstopping and assistance provided by Department. iii. Promote and encourage private investors or PPP whenever commercially viable to implement urban development activities. iv. Promote and maintain aspects that best reflect the best of Bhutanese values, aesthetics and traditional architecture and that is in harmony with the natural environment.

Risk Assessment: i. Poor detailed design of sub-projects ii. Lack of experienced contractors, poor performance of contractors, poor supervision and quality control of works. iii. Lack of suitably trained professionals and contractors. iv. Availability of fund.

Beneficiary: i. Urban population ii. Private sector iii. Farmers

GEOLOGY AND MINES

Au Name: MINISTRY OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS Department: DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY AND MINES

Program Name: Geological Mapping, Mineral Exploration and Sustainable Mineral Development Phase: Approved

Justification: Bhutan has pursued mining activities cautiously bearing in mind the social and environmental consequences. The sector is, therefore, still underdeveloped. While Bhutan has significant deposits of a number of mineral resources, including limestone, coal, graphite, gypsum, slate and dolomite, most mining activities are limited to relatively small operations and mainly involve the above minerals. All the mines in the country are operated using opencast mining technique. Several constraints and challenges have impeded the development of mining sector in Bhutan. The absence of a clear mineral development policy has hampered the management, allocation and monitoring of mines. Similarly, the sector also faces human resource constraints both in the government and the private mining sector which has hampered its effective functioning. Despite the problems, mining will continue to be an important source of revenue and it would be in the interest of Bhutan to manage these resources sustainably. Taking Bhutan's current pace of socio-economic development into an account, the demand for industrial minerals and construction materials will highly increase over the next few decades and therefore, mineral sector will continue to play an important role for Bhutan's socio-economic development as envisaged by Economic Development Policy (EDP) 2010. For a mountainous country like ours where substantially towards Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has become necessity. Mining and mineral based industries has been an important source of foreign exchange and fiscal receipts for the government. These industries have contributed by ways of taxes, employment, wealth creation, exports, spill over to other businesses and helped diversify the economy.

Strategy: i. Prioritize the target areas for mineral investigation and construction materials study during the annual activity plan formulation. ii. Implementation of geological investigation of heavy minerals will be accorded priority. iii. In the interest of ensuring the sustainable mineral development, the department will further strengthen both technical and human capacity of both government and private sectors. iv. Scientific mining will be ensured through improvement of the regulatory framework and its implementation.

Risk Assessment: i. Inadequate human resources and technical capacity. ii. Inadequate financial resources

Beneficiary: i. Private miners ii. Public at large

ENERGY

Au Name: MINISTRY OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS Department: DEPARTMENT OF HYDRO POWER AND POWER SYSTEM

Program Name: Institutional Reforms and Capacity Building Phase: Approved

Justification: Hydropower sector is going to be the main backbone of Bhutanese economy. The total hydropower potential of Bhutan is estimated at 30,000 MW but the country has so far harnessed about less than 10% of the total hydropower potential. In an effort towards positioning Bhutan on a self-reliant footing, harnessing the hydro power potential through accelerating the hydropower development will be very crucial. Equally, It would also be important to sustain the huge investment made for the hydropower plants in the past. All of these would warrant continuous institutional reforms and strengthening of the energy sector to cope with difficult challenges. This program is therefore designed to strengthen the institutional capacity of the energy sector to deliver the mandate of 10,000 MW installed capacity by 2020 and ensure its sustainability.

Strategy: i. Carry out institutional capacity assessments to identify gaps and deficiencies. ii. Conduct organization development exercise to sharpen its focus.

Program Name: Accelerated Hydropower Development & Transmission Network Strengthening Phase: Approved

Justification: The total hydropower potential of Bhutan is estimated at 30,000 MW. But the country has so far been able to harness only about 10% of the total hydropower potential. While the power master plan has identified about 75 project sites, feasibilities and detailed project reports have been carried for few projects. In order to realize the plan objective of self-reliant economy and electricity for all, accelerating hydropower development is the way forward. It will be therefore be appropriate to expeditiously conduct detailed project reports for the potential projects and implement them using sustainable business model. Further, to keep pace with the accelerated hydropower development, power transmission infrastructure (both lines and substations) will require strengthening to evacuate power from the generating stations to various load centers. Therefore, a full electricity grid interconnection between the western, central and eastern region will be necessary to ensure reliable and adequate power supply to the consumers. This is will also contribute towards the goal of making Bhutan energy secure.

Strategy: i. Commission pre-feasibility studies and reconnaissance studies. ii. To reduce dependence on bilateral modes of hydropower development, Independant Power Producers(IPP) and Public Private Partnership(PPP) models will be explored iii. Establish Power Training Institute to address manpower deployment in Hydopower projects. iv. Conduct system strengthening works and take up construction of new transmission lines and associated substations.

Risk Assessment: i. Insufficient and timely availability of fund; ii. Inadequate skilled manpower.

Beneficiary: i. Power/Energy sector

To achieve greater economic efficiency and healthy competition in the trading sector, it is important to continue the efforts of the Department aimed at creating a conducive and enabling environment. This would, amongst others, require development of the managerial skills of the entrepreneurs and improving the efficiency and productivity of the business operations. This program is therefore designed to improve the institutional performance of the trade sector to effectively respond to the impending challenges.

Strategy: i. In order to implement the Consumer Protection Act, an independent office with required manpower under the Ministry will be created. ii. The legal framework will be strengthened through the drafting and enactment of the competition law/policy and trade development act. iii. Under the market modernization, trainings on skills development and awareness on consumer products will be carried out throughout the country. The training will focus mostly on micro traders. iv. To strengthen trade, feasibility study on establishment of wholesale centres in all border towns will be carried out. Further, the Department will strengthen the monitoring of trading activities within the country. v. In the area of up-gradation of the fuel quality, negotiation with oil companies in India & Government of India for early launch of Euro IV fuel will be initiated expeditiously.

Risk Assessment: i. Implementation of Consumer Protection Act, Development of Competition Policy/Law and Trade Development Act might face budget constraint as there is no committed budget from any donor agencies. ii. The relocation of the POL depot entails huge cost and lack of committed budget may deter the relocation work. iii. Lack of adequate skilled professionals might impede the implementation of the above activities

Beneficiary: i. Business entrepreneurs ii. Companies and corporations iii. General consumer,

INDUSTRY

Au Name: MINISTRY OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS Department: DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRY

Program Name: Promotion of sustainable and environment friendly industrial development Phase: Approved

Justification: The industrial sector is one of the critical sectors for sustainable growth and poverty reduction. Past investment in the sector has resulted in significant structural changes in the economy with secondary and tertiary sectors taking over primary sector. However, the structural change has not translated into productive employment opportunities, vibrant private sector growth and economic diversification. The economy continues to be driven by hydropower and construction sectors with limited potential for employment creation. Besides, small domestic market, difficult terrain, high transportation costs, lack of skilled human resources and difficult access to finance remain major challenges to the growth of industries which is dominated by few large manufacturing firms based on mineral and metal and are mostly concentrated in Samtse, Phuntsholing and Sarpang. In light of the above challenges, this program will seek to promote industries that are in sync with the aspiration of the economic development policy of 2010

Strategy: i. Develop and establish Industrial Parks/Special Economic Zones at Bondeyma in Mongar Dzongkhag, Dhandhum in Samtse Dzongkhag, Motanga in Samdrup Jongkhar Dzongkhag and Jigmiling in Sarpang Dzongkhag. ii. Develop and manage Industrial Parks/Special Economic Zones in Jigmeling and Dhamdum. These will be pursued through PPP model. iii. Additional infrastructures in existing industrial estate would be developed and strengthen.

Program Name: Strengthening policy environment and institutional capacity Phase: Approved

Justification: The manufacturing and industries sector has not grown as rapidly as expected. The sector is constrained by various factors that impede its further development. Bhutan's industries have been affected by low levels of productivity, little or no technological advancement and low levels of human capacity. The relatively slower growth and performance the sector can largely be attributed to inadequate or lack of clear and coherent industrial policy and strategy. While the development of the Economic Development Policy in 2010 has provided the roadmap as to the development of industries, the implementation of the policy has remained relatively weak. Further, the International Finance Corporation/World Bank report on 'Ease of Doing Business' ranked Bhutan 142 of 183 countries, clearly highlighting the deficiencies that needs to be addressed going forward. There is therefore, the need to further strengthen the policy environment and institutional capacity of the sector to enhance its effectiveness and efficiency in the delivery of its service.

Strategy: i. Accelerate FDI promotional activities ii. Develop and implement promotional strategy for priority sectors iii. Formulate and implement Investment Act iv. Effective enforcement of companies & enterprise law and protecting Investors v. Institutional restructuring and strengthening of company registry division vi. Up-gradation/improvement of Industry information system

Au Name: MINISTRY OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS Department: DEPARTMENT OF COTTAGE & SMALL INDUSTRIES

Program Name: Development of Cottage & Small Industry in Bhutan Phase: Approved

Justification: There is a growing body of evidence suggesting cottage and small scale industries as an engine of economic and employment growth. Development of cottage, micro and small industries is increasingly recognized as an effective instrument for promoting balanced regional development. Given its high relevance and potential in nurturing inclusive development in Bhutan, the government during the 10th FYP established the Department of Cottage and Small Industry (DCSI) to propel the growth and development of the CSI sector. In working towards promoting an effective CSI sector, it will be crucial to address several constraints and challenges impeding the growth of the sector. These challenges relate to limited access to finance by the CSIs, difficulty to access viable markets, limited industrial infrastructure, limited entrepreneurial talent/skills, use of outmoded technology, high transportation costs, low economy of scale and, poor R&D and innovation culture among enterprises. This program will work towards improving the performance of the private sector development through galvanizing cottage and small industries for industrial and employment generation.

Strategy: i. Strengthen the Policy Environment and Institutional Framework. ii. Strengthen the Legislative Framework and Enterprise Environment. iii. Facilitate Access to Finance and Incentive; iv. Enhance Competitiveness and Innovation; v. Enhance employment and develop a culture of entrepreneurship vi. Improve market access

Risk Assessment: i. Availability of adequate resources; ii. Availability of the land for infrastructures iii. Cooperation from the stakeholders

TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATION

Au Name: MINISTRY OF INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS Department: DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL AVIATION

Program Name: Expension & Strengthening of Air Transport Phase: Draft

Justification: Paro International Airport as the only international airport in the country provides the critical transportation link with the rest of the world. Over the years, passenger volume has increased and air traffic has been growing at the rate of 15 % per annum. This has caused a lot of congestion in the terminal affecting proper delivery of air services and also significantly increasing security issues. Domestic airports are vital and strategic infrastructure on which the tourism and other economic sectors depend upon. It also supports regionally balanced development. In the 10th Plan, three domestic airports were established within minimum infrastructure. In order to operationalize the domestic airports optimally, major investments have to be made to expand the services and security features such as taxiways, aprons, security installations, equipment etc. Institutionally DCA has been tasked with both the regulatory and service provider role which has been resulting in conflict of interest.

Strategy: i. To deliver their services better, the regulatory role and service provider responsibilities will be bifurcated. This will promote better service delivery and standards. ii. Given the passenger traffic congestion in Paro International Airport, investments to expand it will be made. iii. The three domestic airports will be made fully operational by enhancing security features, improving drainage and access, and aviation facilities. This will allow for safer and faster transportation links to other regions of the country, thereby facilitating regionally balanced development. iv. HR will be strengthened to achieve LEI targets

Risk Assessment: i) Airlines may not be able to procure smaller aircraft to operate in STOL airstrips. ii) International airlines may be reluctant to operate into Paro. iii) Resource constraints may not hinder implementation of plan. iv) Unavailability of land replacement may affect the expansion works of PIA. v) Inadequate trained staff which may affect achievement of LEI percentage to meet the minimum acceptable level of ICAO.

Program Name: Expension & Strengthening of Air Transport Phase: Draft

Justification: Safe and efficient transportation is an enabler for socio-economic development. Road transportation in Bhutan which is the primary mode of transportation is very expensive due to the mountainous terrain. This coupled with small domestic market for public transportation, on most routes, makes provision of public transportation commercially unviable. While the road infrastructure has expanded, many rural folks are unable to capitalize on it due to lack of affordable transportation. Road safety and traffic congestion still remains a critical issues that needs to be addressed. Bhutan has the highest road fatality cases in the region which can be attributed mostly to limited enforcement of traffic rules, and poor geometrics of road. The urgency and the need to explore alternative modes of transport, as well as to implement urban transport systems has increased evermore with the rising cost of fuels, increased vehicle numbers and for carbon emission controls.

Strategy: i. Improve accessibility, affordability and reliability of urban and inter-district/ regional passenger and goods transport through provision of subsidies for public transportation and enhanced monitoring of transport services. ii.

Program Name: Promotion and Development of Media Phase: Draft

Justification: The Bhutanese society has largely been an oral society with limited documentation. In this age of information and with the introduction of Parliamentary democracy, media is expected to play the role of informing the public and acting as a watch dog. Also media is an effective way to improve transparency and promote our culture and traditions. The media in Bhutan is a relatively new sector with few trained professionals and having issues of sustainability of private media firms due to the limited domestic market for media products. Also overall access to media is very low at 55%. The legal and policy frameworks are not fully established which leads to challenges in trying to regulate the media sector.

Strategy: i. Strengthening the capacity of media to help them report comprehensively and professionally ii. Strengthening policy and regulatory frameworks to facilitate the development of media sector iii. Facilitating private sector participation in building key infrastructure for multi-media to reduce overheads and improve viability of their projects

Risk Assessment: i. Lack of professional/technical expertise ii. Insufficient Resources iii. Terms not attractive or clear for PPP iv. Resistance of agency to introduction of new policies and regulations

Program Name: Strengthen quality and content of BBSC TV and Radio Phase: Draft

Justification: To strengthen the reliability of BBS Radio and Television news and programme, it is important to strengthen the terrestrial services of BBS. By establishing satellite earth and regional bureau connectivity, BBS would be able to broadcast news and programme produced in different parts of the country very efficiently. Technology is a key component in the improving and expanding content through automation of Radio studios and procurement of professional equipment. Given the limited capacities of BBS, improvement of the content of TV and radio programmes also depends on acquiring and broadcasting locally produced programmes and films. To provide regionally produced news and programmes, establishment of regional studio at Kanglung is necessary. It will also substitute the HQ in case of emergency. Professional enhancement of staff is also critical for quality of content. Further to preserve programme and news for future referencing, establishment of professional video archive is very important.

Strategy: i. Strengthen reliability of BBS radio and Television by installing FM/TV transmitters at strategic locations and connecting the Regional Bureaus with the HQ through E1 link. ii. Improve and expand content of BBS radio and Television by constructing Radio and TV studios at Kanglung, purchasing locally produced programmes, purchase of professional equipment and enhance the capacity of the staff through relevant HRD programmes.

Risk Assessment: i. Not being able to carry out required land acquisition in time which will affect construction of studio. ii. Unable to acquire befitting programs to meet the audience satisfaction. iii. Resource gap to meet the international and domestic standard and quality. iv. Inadequate number of staff being provided which will affect implementation of plans.

Beneficiary: BBS audience and viewers.

EDUCATION

Au Name: MINISTRY OF EDUCATION Department: DEPARTMENT OF SCHOOL EDUCATION

Program Name: Access and Sustainability of School Education Phase: Approved

Justification: Recent statistics shows that good progress has been achieved in providing access to education. Gender parity has been achieved at primary and secondary education level, while it is improving at higher secondary and tertiary level. The current challenge is providing the proverbial "last mile access" to achieve Universal Primary Education. It is estimated that about 2% of primary school age children are not in school. These are children from i) remote and hard to reach area; ii) migrant population; and iii) the urban poor including those with special needs. The past Five Year Plans saw rapid expansion of school infrastructure to provide access to education. Today, the situation is one where student numbers, especially in rural areas, are declining at primary and secondary levels while demand for higher secondary and tertiary education is increasing. This demand cannot be met without further investments in school infrastructure. Furthermore, the phasing out of donor assistance has posed numerous challenges in terms of sustainability of some of its important programmes.

Strategy: i. Rationalize small, unsustainable schools where enrolment is low and is likely to decline further. ii. Consolidate schools with boarding, bussing services allowing for a critical mass of students that warrants better investments and facilitates provision of resource. iii. Strengthen Special Education Services for improving access to schools and ECCD programmes for better preparedness for new entrants to primary schools. iv. Facilitate the establishment of private schools and international schools to develop a more sustainable education system and promote Bhutan as an educational hub. v. Improve disaster preparedness and response in schools vi. Improve preparedness for donor phasing out by developing an Action Plan for replacing WFP's school feeding.

Risk Assessment: i. The continuing teacher shortage in remote schools may affect the proper functioning of schools. ii. If adequate budget is not provided, it will affect the implementation of the capital intensive school consolidation plans. iii. If reliable data on out-of-school children is not available, it will affect evidence-based planning and decision-making iv. Overall human resource shortages both teaching and management should affect the implementation of the plan

Beneficiary: Students, teachers, parents, of school going children, NFE learners and the wider community.

Au Name: MINISTRY OF EDUCATION Department: DEPARTMENT OF SCHOOL EDUCATION

Program Name: Relevance and Quality of School Education Phase: Approved

Justification: Access to education must be accompanied and supported by quality in the contents of education. In an increasingly globalized and fast changing world, the education system should not only provide students with the highest standards of learning but also inculcate in them the right values, attitudes and skills so that they are able to lead a happy and productive life. Although no empirical study has been conducted, there are concerns that the quality of education in Bhutan has declined over the years. Therefore, this Programme complemented by the Teachers Support Services Programme aims to improve relevance and quality of education and support the national aspiration to become a knowledge-based society.

Strategy: i. Strengthen the performance management system in schools to ensure that teachers are performing optimally, thereby resulting in better learning outcomes for students. This includes developing an ICT system to make it efficient and tamper proof. ii. Implement the "Educating for GNH initiative" to ensure the philosophy of GNH permeates every aspect of the school. iii. Develop and implement the ICT Masterplan to ensure that students are equipped with ICT skills and knowledge as an important aspect of their learning.

Risk Assessment: i. Adequate human resources especially technical expertise to maintain the IT services, not being available will jeopardize the implementation of this programme ii. Unavailability of teachers to serve in remote schools will negatively impact the student's education iii. Unavailability of resources, including those traditionally supported by Development Partners will impact delivery of those activities.

Beneficiary: Students, teachers, parents of school going children and the wider community.

Au Name: MINISTRY OF EDUCATION Department: DEPARTMENT OF CURRICULUM RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT

Program Name: Curriculum Research and Development Phase: Approved

Justification: The quality of the school curriculum and its implementation broadly determines the quality of the learning outcomes for students. In the long term, it will have a strong bearing on the overall quality of human resources of the country. A curriculum of good quality and standards will help the future leaders of our country to navigate the Nation through the 21st century. A well trained group of curriculum developers would be able to weigh the curriculum through various dimensions. Well trained teachers supported with relevant resources and professional development programmes, will achieve the intent of the curriculum. Currently the department suffers from shortage of staff with expertise in curriculum development and lacks a strong and institutionalized system for monitoring and co-ordination of the introduction of new curricula.

Strategy: i. Strengthen the existing curriculum for all subjects making it relevant and meaningful. This will be implemented through close co-ordination and consultation with all relevant stakeholders and based on scientific review. ii. Invest in building capacities of curriculum officers and ensure their expertise is recognized by RCSC in their management of specialists and professionals. This is to ensure that their expertise continues to benefit the department. iii. Strengthen the management system for introducing and monitoring the new curricula.

Risk Assessment: i. Continued shortage of both Curriculum Officers and other staff in the Department, pose a risk of not being able to implement activities effectively. ii. Lack of training in curriculum design and publishing for the staff is a major problem and as such our work needs to be outsourced on many occasions. Outsourcing is also not very effective.

Beneficiary: School teachers, students and the community and nation at large

Au Name: MINISTRY OF EDUCATION Department: DEPARTMENT OF ADULT & HIGHER EDUCATION

Program Name: Higher Education Services Phase: Approved

Justification: Higher education is essential for the development of human capital of any country. Given that Bhutan seeks to pursue the objective transforming into a knowledge-based society, investments in higher education opportunities are vital. Furthermore skilled and specialized human resources are required for providing services in all sectors, especially in the health, technical and education sector. This continues to be addressed through scholarships in important areas/ studies. Moreover investments into expanding access to primary and secondary education have resulted in growing numbers of Bhutanese students seeking higher education every year. Being unable to accommodate all the students, many Bhutanese students pursue their tertiary education outside the country, many in institutions of questionable repute. Facilitating the establishment of reputable tertiary education institutes will also address this issue.

Strategy: i. Strengthen the regulatory framework and quality assurance systems to facilitate establishment of quality tertiary education institutions (TEIs). ii. Enhance the strategic planning and monitoring system for scholarships to ensure scholarships are well aligned to national needs, managed effectively with sustainability as a key question being addressed. iii. Strengthen services such as information and advisory services to students, as well as facilitating linkages for TEIs such as accreditations etc. iv. Encourage participation of girls in tertiary education through policy and other interventions.

Risk Assessment: i. Lack of adequate resources to implement the programme especially the scholarship activities which are largely dependent on development partners. ii. Adequate human resources with necessary skills and knowledge to manage tertiary education may not be available which will seriously affect the implementation of the entire programme

Beneficiary: Direct beneficiaries will be aspiring and meritorious students seeking tertiary education. Other beneficiaries will be the existing tertiary education institutions, private investors and companies seeking to set up TEIs, corporations, community and the country at large.

Au Name: MINISTRY OF EDUCATION Department: DEPARTMENT OF ADULT & HIGHER EDUCATION

Program Name: Adult Literacy and Lifelong Learning Phase: Approved

Justification: Literacy is seen as one of the key instruments for poverty alleviation and thus the achievement our development philosophy of GNH. The government started the non-formal education programme in 1991 to provide basic literacy and functional skills to the adult population. The programme has been very effective in providing literacy to our illiterate population bringing adult literacy 52.8% in 2005 to 55.3% in 2012. Undoubtedly literacy has played a big role improving their lives, providing access to information, knowledge. It has also empowered the communities to participate in developmental activities, decision-making and the political process. In the 11th Plan, the primary focus will be to enhance the adult literacy rate to 70%. To achieve this, there has to be a two-pronged approach of enhancing access to education as well as improving the quality through augementing the skills of the instructors Community Learning Centres. Furthermore, the NFE curriculum will need to be revamped to include life skills and other relevant skills, which it currently lacks. In order to institute s system of continuous learning, opportunities will need to be provided to those who could not continue formal education and wish to upgrade their qualifications through the continuing education programme.

Strategy: i. Enhance NFE curriculum by including a functional English curriculum and other life skills, and developing an equivalency framework. ii. Improve the quality of NFE instructors by building their capacities iii. Revitalize Community Learning Centres with provision of basic equipment and other resources. iv. Strengthen monitoring and review system for the Non Formal Education through literacy mapping to target key geographical areas where illiteracy rates are high and also close monitoring of current activities to facilitate sharper interventions. v. Facilitate provision of Continuing Education Programme to support enhancement of academic qualifications.

Risk Assessment: i. Most activities under the non-formal education programme are supported by development partners. With development partners phasing out support from Bhutan, sustainability would be an issue and a risk. ii. Currently the rate of attrition of NFE Instructors is quite high which affects the quality of NFE. If NFE instructors cannot be retained, it will jeopardize the programme. iii. Similarly there is also the risk of being unable to retain trained CE tutors on which the efficacy of the CE depends.

Beneficiary: The illiterate population, in-service personnel, out of school youths, neo-literates and the wider community.

Au Name: MINISTRY OF EDUCATION Department: DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH & SPORTS

Program Name: Youth Development Phase: Approved

Justification: Economic development of a nation depends on young and productive people. They represent hopes and future aspirations of the country. In Bhutan, youth account for about 35% of our population and constitute a unique group with a positive force and enormous potential to contribute to development. Recognizing their important role in society, numerous programmes and initiatives are in place to improve the well-being of youth. Young people today face numerous challenges as a result of the rapid pace of development in the last few decades. This underscores the importance of complementing academic programmes with commensurate interventions to equip our youth with knowledge and skills so that they are able to cope with challenges they are presented with, and fulfill their roles as future custodians of the country. In view of this, youth development will be pursued as a priority programme in the 11th Plan.

Strategy: i. Youth development needs is a cross cutting theme, which requires concerted and coordinated effort amongst many stakeholders. The implementation of a National Youth Action Plan, which has been developed through wide stakeholder consultation, will be an important strategy. ii. Address youth issues in urban centers and dzongkhags with a sizeable youth population through provision of youth friendly integrated services and facilities. iii. Provide resources and opportunities to youth for holistic development through career education, vocational education, cultural, spiritual programs, scouting and life skills programs. iv. Strengthen parenting education to help them provide the necessary support and guidance to their children and wards in this fast changing world.

Risk Assessment: i. Donor supported projects run the risk of sustainability as donor phase out their support. ii. Adequate resources may not be available which will affect the implementation of the activities. iii. Adequate human resources may not be available which in turn will affect the delivery of activities.

Beneficiary: Youth and their parents as well as the community at large.

Au Name: MINISTRY OF EDUCATION Department: SECRETARIAT

Program Name: Teacher Support Services Phase: Approved

Justification: In all our past Five Year Plans, tremendous amount of capital investments have been made in expanding access to education. This is corroborated by the fast growth rates of Net enrollment rates for primary and secondary education which are currently; Primary Net Enrolment Ratio at 96%, Adjusted Net Enrolment Ratio at 98% and Basic Net Enrolment Ratio at 94%. One of the primary issues faced by the education sector is improving the quality of education while simultaneously striving to increase enrolment. There is a perception that quality has not kept pace with the expansion of the education system and that there is a need to improve the quality of education. With teachers being the backbone of the education system, the quality of education hinges on the quality of teachers. Hence, there is a need to address the issue of teacher shortages and professionalize the teaching profession.

Strategy: i. To professionalize the teaching profession, the INSET Master plan which aims to ensure that all teachers acquire the minimum standard professional development, will be implemented. ii. A Professional Development Division will be set up to solely focus and successfully implement the plans to professionalize the teaching profession. iii. To address the shortage of teachers and unattractiveness of the profession, better living conditions, decent working environment and attractive pay/ allowances will be provided iv. HR management of teachers to allow fairness and transparency in decision making will be strengthened. Furthermore, the Teachers' HR policy which among other things looks at institutionalization of career pathways and performance management will be implemented.

Risk Assessment: i. Inadequate financial resources will jeopardize the implementation of INSET, HRD activities. ii. Inadequate HR both managerial and technical will affect implementation of this programme. iii. Other departments and divisions of the Ministry and other relevant stakeholders may not prioritize the implementation of this programme leading to delays and other implementation bottlenecks

Beneficiary: Teachers, students, parents of school going children and the society at large.

Program Name: Institutional Development Phase: Approved

Justification: The various offices under the Secretariat, which include Policy and Planning Division, Human Resource Division, Administration and Finance Division, Internal Audit Division, Information and Communication Division, and National Commission for UNESCO, provide the Secretariat support services to the technical departments. Specifically, they provide services such as Five and Annual plan formulation, resource mobilization, monitoring, co-ordination and evaluation, providing administrative and procurement services, performing HR functions, ensuring compliance with rules and regulations, etc. Currently, the Ministry faces severe crunch in terms of office space, with many departments and divisions working out of semi-permanent structures and rented spaces. This has not been conducive to service delivery, effective co-ordination and resource sharing within the Ministry.

Strategy: i. Construct Secretariat building to ease space crunch, promote efficient service delivery and co-ordination amongst the various departments, divisions of the Ministry. ii. Finalize and implement the National Education Policy. iii. Strengthen and streamline HR Development and management systems for the large numbers of personnel under the Ministry. iv. Use IT to strengthen education management information and inventory systems for greater efficiency and cost effectiveness. v. Strengthen monitoring and implementation of plans, policies and programmes

Risk Assessment: i. Risk of land for construction of Secretariat building being insufficient due to the current land issue with Dzongkha Development Commission. ii. Inadequate manpower and technical capacity in the Ministry, which will affect implementation of plans. iii. Timely adequate financial resources not being provided which will jeopardize the implementation of plans.

Program Name: Enhancing Access to Tertiary Education (in RUB) Phase: Approved

Justification: Most countries which consider themselves as knowledge-based society are characterized by very high GER over 60 to 70 % of the age cohort between 19 and 23 years of age. However, the GER in Bhutan is only around 18%. The target in the 11th plan is to increase to 35%, of which RUB aims to contribute 15%. This translates to increase in total intake capacity of 14000 by 2018 in the 8 member colleges. It is learned that increasing access to tertiary education increases employment opportunities, reduce poverty, develop social capital, reduce crime and health risk, and boost democratic culture and improve overall quality of life. Currently there are around 9000 students with total academic faculties of 490, and non-academic staff of 286. In order to ensure accommodation of 14,000 students by 2018, there is a need to increase the number of staff and expand infrastructure and facilities such as laboratories, libraries, sports facilities, classrooms, hostels and staff quarters. Further, as envisioned in vision 2020, the university is expected to enhance continuing education programmes. This provision will enhance access to tertiary education for those who would not have the opportunity to undergo higher studies through the regular full-time mode of study.

Strategy: i. RUB will consolidate and enhance complementary infrastructures to accommodate at least 1000 to 1500 regular students in each of their member colleges. Additional faculty and administrative staff will be recruited to support the expansion plan. Infrastructure and facilities especially ICT will be strengthened to suit the need of continuing education programmes to enable diversified groups of students to access higher education and training programs. ii. RUB will also embrace more private colleges as affiliated colleges of the Royal University of Bhutan to allow private sectors to complement government efforts in expanding access to tertiary education. PPP will also be explored as an option to develop residential facilities.

Risk Assessment: Inadequate funding might hamper the expansion of the proposed infrastructure and related facilities. The students' accommodations which are planned under PPP modality are subject to the availability of private partners, which is not certain.

Beneficiary: Students who are able to access the undergraduate and post graduate programs are the direct beneficiaries. Indirectly, the society at large will benefit as RUB will be producing the critical mass of the educated society in the country.

Au Name: ROYAL UNIVERSITY OF BHUTAN Department: SECRETARIAT

Program Name: Enhancing Quality and Relevance of Tertiary Education Phase: Approved

Justification: Enhancing the quality of teaching and learning has been a crucial factor for ensuring employability. The RUB has to enhance the quality of teaching and learning in order to ensure that the graduates are not only employable within the country but are also readily absorbed in the international job market. RUB is also required to graduate students who would not only look for jobs but create jobs as entrepreneurs since the private sector is still very small and employers in the current job market is limited. Also due to changing technology and emergence of new knowledge in the market, university is expected to diversify programs for the up keep of the relevance of the knowledge and skills that are required in the job market. Therefore a number of new programmes both at undergraduate and post graduate levels need to be introduced. RUB believes that achieving qualifications and securing 'employment' alone is not sufficient to measure the quality of its graduates. The quality of its graduates should also include high level of personal development with mindset and behavior that demonstrates qualities such as conscientiousness, compassion, loving care, respect for others and sense of responsibility to the society. Therefore, development of GNH inspired education that embraces personal development studies will be a critical aspect of quality of education in the RUB.

Strategy: To ensure quality of teaching and learning in the colleges, RUB will further strengthen the quality assurance system. Infrastructure and facilities will be upgraded including ICT and libraries to support the changing needs and quality of the academic programmes. Quality of faculty will be ensured with rigorous implementation of human resource development plan and with introduction of initiatives that boost staff motivation.

RUB will also connect students to the world of works, creating opportunities for students to take up field based skills such as vocational programmes, internship, on-the-job training and other related activities. Students' services will also be enhanced to promote environment that is conducive to quality teaching-learning. The existing Entrepreneurship Cells will be further developed so that they become vibrant and dynamic centers for aspiring entrepreneurs with exciting ideas and incubation of businesses.

A GNH values & holistic education modules and critical pedagogy & contemplative education modules will be instituted across the colleges as a foundation of all programmes. Such an approach is expected to make learning more consistent with GNH values and principles. Spiritual development activities, mindfulness practices, community services and related activities will be encouraged and supported all across colleges for personal growth and development, and to inculcate sense of responsibility to the society and the environment. Ideas and activities leading to the development of green campuses will be promoted.

Risk Assessment: Due to limited number of qualified and competent people in the market, RUB may not be able to get adequate pool of people for the development and delivery of programmes as per the plan. Therefore, this might risk the delivery of programmes as per the plan, unless RUB works out a dynamic HR strategy to address staff shortage.

Beneficiary: Students and faculties of the member colleges will be benefited directly. However with improvement in quality of teaching and learning, nation as a whole will benefit as RUB will be producing a critical mass of educated citizens, which is key to economic growth of the country.

Au Name: ROYAL UNIVERSITY OF BHUTAN Department: SECRETARIAT

Program Name: Promoting Research, Innovation and Enterprise Phase: Approved

Justification: Research and development is one of the core functions of the University. The Royal Charter mandates the RUB to promote and conduct research, and to contribute to the creation of knowledge of relevance to Bhutan. As mandated and to emphasize the crucial role of research, the Department of Research was established in 2005 and was entrusted with the task of promoting research in the university. However, the department is faced with many challenges including developing research capacity, creating an enabling research environment, enhancing academic knowledge of publication and lack of access to financial support. In view of these RUB plans to promote research and development in the 11th plan and endeavors to develop itself as a 'think-tank' to meaningfully contribute to the academic engagement, scholarship, technological innovation in government agencies and industry. It also includes academic support in the formulation of policies and other decision making processes. RUB will also offer research based masters and PhD programs to help build research capacities in the country.

Strategy: To promote research, innovation and development, RUB will adopt some of the following key strategies: - Consolidate structures and institutions to meaningfully engage the university with the economy, government and the larger society. - Enhance the culture of research by encouraging incorporation of research and inquiry in the undergraduate programmes where possible and introducing postgraduate studies through research leading to PhD. - Build research capacity by enhancing number of faculty with PhDs to 25% by the end of 11th plan. - To encourage research, faculties will be engaged in research by reducing 4% of the teaching workload, engage in collaboration with other research institutes, organize workshops, seminars, international conferences. - Diversify sources of income such as endowment, gifts, donations, short-courses, research, consultancy services and rents to ensure financial sustainability of the university. - Integrate research achievement in the performance evaluation.

Risk Assessment: The shortage of faculties in the university may limit faculty to take up research works. Moreover, if the proposed research grant does not come through, the research works may not take off as RUB on its own does not have any research fund to support research and innovation in the university.

Beneficiary: The promotion of research and innovation will benefit students, faculties, industries, government and society at large.

Au Name: ROYAL EDUCATION COUNCIL Department: SECRETARIAT

Program Name: Strengthen and Promote Innovation, Creativity and Enterprise in Education Phase: Approved

Justification: Education plays a crucial role in building a productive work force, reducing poverty and ultimately in improving the prospects for the emergence of a knowledge-based society in Bhutan. REC will continue to strengthen its research capacity through instituting a culture of research and research-based approaches to planning and policy development. It will also conduct credible research and publish both at national and international levels and develop into a pioneering autonomous educational research organization in Bhutan. Through its research activities, it will develop new approaches to education, educational policies and programs/curriculum which are strongly grounded on evidence, to enhance innovation, creativity and enterprise in education. Their research will translate into pilot projects in SEED schools before recommendations will be made for adoption into the mainstream education system.

Strategy: i. Collaborate and seek support from relevant stakeholders, such as the Ministry of Education, the Royal University of Bhutan and others in implementing its recommendations. ii. Research and pilot innovative educational approaches and related programs in educational institutions, including schools and colleges. iii. Develop effective mechanism to implement, monitor, and support its programs. iv. Share responsibilities in supporting relevant agencies especially their pilot agencies with technical backstopping and guidance. v. Monitor and initiate timely evaluation of its activities through quarterly and annual reports to the REC Council and GNHC.

Risk Assessment: i. REC as a research think-tank must rely on its key stakeholders, such as the Ministry of Education, Royal ii. University of Bhutan, Colleges and schools etc. to access information and carry out research activities. It is not an implementing agency therefore, its achievements and impact depend on the relevant stakeholder's input iii. Limited human resource capacity within REC may hamper in realization of its vision, mission and mandates.

Au Name: ROYAL INSTITUTE OF MANAGEMENT Department: SECRETARIAT

Program Name: Management Program in Support of Good Governance Phase: Approved

Justification: The Royal Institute of Management was established in 1986 and was incorporated as an autonomous institute in 1990 under the Royal Charter with a Board of Directors as its governing authority. It is mandated to impart, promote and improve professional knowledge and skills in management and pubic administration in both public and private sector. RIM therefore aims to accomplish as the premier centre of excellence in management development to produce socially and professionally responsible, proactive leaders and managers. During the 11th plan, RIM will be expanding its training programmes including the post graduate diploma, masters and management development programs to meet the needs of the civil service, corporate, private and civil society organization. A total of around 15000 personnel will be trained through regular and in-service management development programs with an annual turnover of almost 3000 personnel against existing annual turnover of 500-600 personnel. The pre-service programs are designed to impart managerial skills and facilitate employability of graduates and the in-service programs are expected to upgrade the professional skills of managers/leaders across all organization including corporations and non-governmental organizations. The expansion of programs further demands expansion of infrastructure facilities and faculties.

Strategy: To ensure institutionalization and delivery of masters program, RIM will continue to work with the University of Canberra, Australia, under the RGoB and AusAID support. RIM will establish institutional linkages with other renowned institutes/ universities and explore volunteer professors to address faculty shortages. RIM will closely work with RCSC to design and deliver MDP programs at all levels of the civil service and with the concerned agencies on the customized training courses like procurement management, ethics and integrity, local governance, etc. Research and development will be promoted to enhance quality of teaching and sustainability of the RIM.

Risk Assessment: The delivery of newly developed masters program and proposed MDP program will depend on the availability of funding support from the government and development partners such as AusAID. Further, it also depends on the availability of qualified faculties and the ability to retain and motivate those faculties to deliver the proposed programs.

Beneficiary: At large the students who have completed class-XII, graduates and in-service personnel who avail the diploma, masters program will be the direct beneficiaries. The in-service MDP programs are expected to upgrade the professional skills of managers/leaders across all organizations and facilitate good governance and better public service delivery.

HEALTH

Au Name: MINISTRY OF HEALTH Department: DEPARTMENT OF MEDICAL SERVICES

Program Name: Medical Services Phase: Approved

Justification: The overarching goal of the 'Medical Services' is to deliver quality medical services and increase access to all citizens of the country. In terms of health indicators, Bhutan has made great improvements in most parameters related to the achievement of MDGs. Today, Bhutan is at a juncture of epidemiological transition marked by an increase in the burden of non-communicable and lifestyle diseases such as hypertension, diabetes while it still has the task of tackling communicable diseases like TB, malaria. In addition there has also been major demographic shifts bringing with it emerging issues of adolescent health and aging health issues. We have also witnessed several manmade and natural disasters in the recent years which has claimed lives and damaged properties. Health services has to be made accessible for the unreached population, which includes nomadic, migratory and peri-urban communities. In terms of service delivery, the general perception is that it needs to be improved and made more efficient. Furthermore, there is increasing pressure for efficient delivery of services and higher service standards.

Strategy: i. Standardization of health services across all health institutions. ii. Improve access to healthcare services by reaching the unreached population through mobile camps, ORCs, construction of sub-post and other innovative approaches iii. Explore feasibility of granting autonomy to JDWNRH and Regional Referral Hospitals iv. Enhance preparedness and response to emergencies and disasters in the Health Facilities and provide access to emergency services by creating EMS Division, improving HHC, establishing trauma centers, EMoNC, essential surgical services, and High Altitude Medicine Program v. Improve access and delivery of services by establishing CT scan & endoscopy facilities in the two regional hospitals and by using ICT enabled health care solutions such as telemedicine vi. Strengthen nursing care services by creating Nursing Division

Risk Assessment: i. Non- availability of financial resources will jeopardize the implementation of the plans. ii. Lack of HR capacity will affect timely implementation of the plans. iii. There is the possibility that inter-sectoral collaboration/community partnership may not be forthcoming

Au Name: MINISTRY OF HEALTH Department: DEPARTMENT OF MEDICAL SERVICES

Program Name: Traditional Medical Services Phase: Approved

Justification: The Ministry of Health envisages integration of traditional medicine with the modern health care system with nation's rich bio-diversity and proven medical qualities of plants. The maintenance of traditional medicine not only adds dimensions to the nation's system of health care, but also provides an alternative choice of health care service. It should also be regarded as a conscious decision to conserve a part of our rich and varied cultural heritage. Recognizing the importance of expansion coverage of traditional medicine services to unreached rural populations to curb morbidity statistics in the country, traditional medicine services planning capacity will be strengthened. To reduce underutilization in some locations, streamlining traditional medicine service through development of standard operating procedures will be pursued.

Strategy: i. Strengthen the traditional medicine services by up-gradation of TM Division to Department of TM, and expanding services, wherever necessary, ii. Optimize operation and improve efficiency by corporatizing MSP and commercializing its products; iii. A Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) compliant facility to be established to ensure production of quality and safe medicines that addresses the demand for it. iv. Strengthen the production of Herbal health products and introduce new products to encourage business entities institute SPA therapies and wellness centers. v. Collaborate with relevant stakeholders to promote sustainable sourcing of raw materials by establishing medicinal herb gardens and promote domestication of rare and endangered species of medicinal plants. vi. Strengthen research capacity to promote evidence based treatments and services and facilitate integration of TM with allopathic medicine

Risk Assessment: i. Demand for traditional medicine services may not be met if GMP is not constructed. ii. If sufficient and qualified personnel are not available, integration of TM with modern medicine as well as development of new products will be affected. iii. Unavailability of Inadequate financial resources will affect implementation of plans.

Beneficiary: Patients, general public and business firms engaged with wellness centers.

Au Name: MINISTRY OF HEALTH Department: DEPARTMENT OF MEDICAL SERVICES

Program Name: Medicines, Technologies and Logistics Phase: Approved

Justification: The efficient and effective delivery of health services depends on steady and adequate stock of medical supplies like medicines equipment and machines. However, the health sector continues to face the insufficient of stock of essential medicines, irrational use of essential medicines, inappropriate/under utilization of high-end health technologies, and sometimes-irrational introduction of Health technologies. The main reason for these gaps is due to a clear strategy/guidelines that ensures proper planning and co-ordination among the relevant Departments/Divisions and Units within the Ministry. These factors can contribute to lack of access to, or inappropriate utilization and inefficient utilization of essential medical services and products, and waste of financial resources.

Strategy: i. Strengthening procurement system for essential drugs to ensure timely and adequate supplies. This includes developing an ICT based indenting and store management system. ii. Strengthening monitoring and evaluation on utilization of medicines and technologies to address the issues of irrational and inappropriate use of medicines and technologies. iii. Enhance evidence and value-based decisions in assessing the technologies to ensure selection of useful and cost effective technologies. This includes investment in building HR capacities in essential medicines and technologies. iv. Strengthening the system for maintenance for specialized medical equipment to allow for their efficient and effective functioning.

Risk Assessment: i. If adequate and skilled personnel are not available, it will affect the selection and maintenance of specialized medical equipment. ii. Dependency on suppliers and vendors and 100% advance payment which delays in availability of spare parts, hence delays repair and service of equipments.

Au Name: MINISTRY OF HEALTH Department: SECRETARIAT

Program Name: Institutional Strengthening & Monitoring Phase: Approved

Justification: The various offices under the Secretariat, which include Policy and Planning Division, Human Resource Division, Administration and Finance Division, Internal Audit Division and Bhutan Health Trust Fund provide the Secretariat support services to the technical departments. Specifically, they provide services such as Five and Annual plan formulation, resource mobilization, monitoring, coordination and evaluation, providing administrative and procurement services, performing HR functions, ensuring compliance with rules and regulations, etc. Amongst them, the Human Resource Division is one of the critical divisions which has to address the issues of i) the shortages of medical and technical professionals in specific categories, ii) Limited specialized skills of the health care providers and iii) low motivation of the health care providers. Health planning and monitoring and evaluation capacity at central and local government level (including analysis and use of health information has to be strengthened. The capacities to conduct health economic policy research and analysis are very limited and needs to be enhanced. This is important given the future sustainability issues of health services. Quality of services needs to be enhanced through standardization of services, monitoring and regulation of health professionals and practices. To allow for greater effectiveness of health services, inter-sectoral collaboration and community partnership with private sector and NGOs needs to be developed.

Strategy: i. Strengthen HR management and coordination to increase skills and number of health professionals. ii. Strengthen health planning and monitoring through using results based planning approach and developing a robust Health Information System. iii. Strengthen the legal and regulatory framework for Health sector through enactment of Health Act. iv. Improve sustainability of health care financing through exploring alternative options such as introduction of billing system and charging of non- Bhutanese and improving off-hour clinic. v. Developing capacity and systems for health research to allow for better preparedness and targeting of vulnerable groups, areas and periods. vi. Expanding ICT-enabled health care services such as telemedicine, video consultations etc. vii. Institute Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) in health facilities. viii. Strengthening of the BMHC and BHTF Secretariats to improve regulatory and financing functions.

Risks i. If adequate human resource are not provided, it will affect the implementation of plans. ii. Due rapid change in health system and advancement in medical technologies, it is costly to procure and maintain them. If adequate resources are not made available, it will jeopardize the implementation of plans. iii. Health cuts across sectors and depends on the co-ordination and cooperation from other stakeholders. If this is not forthcoming, it will affect the plans.

Program Name: Public Health Services Phase: Draft

Justification: The socio-economic development of a country depends on the productivity and well being of its citizens which in turn, amongst many other things, also depends on their state of health. In terms of health indicators, Bhutan has made great improvements in most parameters related to the achievement of MDGs. Today, Bhutan is at a juncture of epidemiological transition marked by an increase in the burden of non-communicable diseases while it still has the task of tackling communicable diseases like TB, malaria, coupled with emerging and reemerging diseases due to climate change. Sedentary lifestyles with traditionally high fat based diets coupled with consumption of tobacco and alcohol has lead to increasing rate of diabetes, hypertension, cancers etc. The cost of treating NCDs is very expensive and hence there is a need to intensify our efforts on health promotion to prevent the onset of these diseases and manage them better for reduced morbidity. Similarly, efforts towards preventive actions for communicable disease must continue to ensure better health for our citizens.

Strategy: i. Strengthen capacity for event based surveillance (EBS) and indicator based surveillance towards all hazard approach and establish link with other sectors for risk assessment and response to public health events. ii. Develop and implement an integrated national strategy for sanitation and hygiene. iii. Operationalize PHL to improve efficiency and effectiveness of laboratory based disease surveillance, response system, to act as national reference laboratory for quality assessment of water; food and drug testing; and other special testing services. iv. Develop and strengthen National Initiative for improving nutrition and micro-nutrient deficiencies. v. Advocate for Health in all Policies for ensuring mainstreaming of health concerns in the planning and implementation of all sectors' programmes. vi. Integrate management of Neonatal and Childhood illness with MCH, CDD, ARI and nutrition programmes to improve health of mother and child. vii. Scale up and intensify implementation, management and monitoring of key programmes of HIV and TB viii. Implement Health Strategies for vulnerable groups of youth, differently abled and elderly persons. ix. Integrate prevention and advocacy of NCDs with PHC??? x. Strengthen outreach of health services through urban and village health workers and maintenance of current vaccines and expansion of new vaccines.

Risk Assessment: Possible Risks are: i. Lacks of Funds- Most of the Public Health Programs are donor funded. Phasing out of donors is seen as a possible risk which might hamper the implementation of the plan and achieving the targets as set. ii. Turnover of key technical staff and lack of adequate trained HR may affect the implementation of the plan. iii. Responsibility of improving health status is spread beyond health sector. Inter-sectoral/multi-sectoral collaboration and community participation is required in furthering the cause of health promotion and effectiveness of its strategies. If this is not forthcoming, it will jeopardize the plan.

Beneficiary: Vulnerable groups, patients, mothers, children and community.

Au Name: UNIVERSITY OF MEDICAL SCIENCE OF BHUTAN Department: NA

Program Name: University of Medical Sciences of Bhutan (UMSB) Phase: Draft

Justification: Despite tremendous initiatives through increase of under graduate medical slots, recruitment of expatriate doctors and expansion for postgraduate programs, health sector still faces acute shortage of medical doctors, nurses and technicians. This trend is expected to continue to due to the expansion of health facilities across the country. With growing socio-economic development and demographic transition, there is rising expectation from the people on the quality of health care services. Changes in morbidity pattern and the rapid medical technological advancement are also putting increasing pressure on health services. Therefore, there is an urgent need for establishment of a medical university in the country to train and provide knowledge and skills to our people. Also, to strengthen the development and integration of indigenous/traditional medicines with allopathic medicines in the country.

Strategy: i. To have UMSB fully operational in the 11th FYP, the JDWNRH, RIHS, NITM and NTMH shall be incorporated under it. ii. Develop institutional linkages and affiliations with renowned health institutions to access resources and ensure quality and standards in teaching. i. Faculty recruitment and development, curriculum and teaching materials development and engage both national and international faculties to form a balanced team of faculty. ii. Construction of infrastructure shall be implemented in tandem and in a phased manner starting from 2013. iii. To improve future financial sustainability, attract international students through competitive fee structure.

Risk Assessment: i. If adequate human resources are not provided, it will affect the implementation of plans, especially specialized health professional from outside Bhutan are critical for the University's academic programme to take off. ii. If adequate financial resources are not made available, it will jeopardize the implementation of plans.

EMPLOYMENT AND HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT

Au Name: MINISTRY OF LABOUR & HUMAN RESOURCES Department: DEPARTMENT OF EMPLOYMENT

Program Name: Promotion of full and productive employment Phase: Approved

Justification: Access to decent and gainful employment is necessary to enable individuals to lead socially productive life and to achieve economic stability. It is estimated that out of 140,000 job seekers who will be entering the labour market during the plan period, about 88,000 will be the youth. Therefore, this program will focus mainly on the advocacy and counseling, school to work transition activities, promoting youth entrepreneurship, strengthening employment services and providing timely and reliable labour market information to enable effective planning and informed decision making in training and employment opportunities. This program will build synergies and linkages among various stakeholders in adopting multi-pronged and holistic approaches to employment creation and promotion strategies.

Strategy: i. Restructuring the school to work transition program for the youth and school leavers to provide necessary skills, work attitude and on the job experience to enhance their employability ii. Encouraging self-employment for youth through entrepreneurship development program iii. Revamping of ploughing back of youth to rural areas in collaborative program with the MoAF and MoEA to provide better sources of employment and livelihood iv. Strengthening the employment service centres both in the regions and head quarter for timely and effective information on employment opportunities. This includes revamping of job portal system to improve the delivery of employment facilitation services as well as periodic market surveys and studies to provide up to date and relevant information on employment matters. v. Developing innovative strategies for creating awareness on career and employment opportunities in collaboration with other relevant stakeholders for students, school leavers and parents. vi. 7. Implementing employment facilitation and promotion in close consultation and collaboration with stakeholders on PPP model.

Risk Assessment: i. Employment being cross-sectoral in nature, the success of this programme will depend on the commitment and cooperation of various stakeholders in the Government as well as in the private sector. ii. The availability of jobs depends on a stable and sound economic growth to boost employment and investment opportunities. iii. Availability of budget and manpower to implement the plans effectively. iv. 4. Willingness of the youth to take up employment and training opportunities.

Beneficiary: Job Seekers and the public at large.

Programme Name: Promotion of decent working conditions and work environment Phase: Approved

Justification: This programme aims to provide decent and happy working environment in the private sector through effective enforcement of the Act and Regulations governing working conditions and OHS in workplaces. As an integral part of the grievances settlement mechanism, Labour Tribunal will be established to offer quick, informal and inexpensive way of settling disputes arising out of work or workplaces. This programme will also address delivery of prompt and efficient public services pertaining to the foreign workers recruitment and labour inspection services through the Labour Net, Labour Inspection Reporting Systems and decentralization of foreign worker approval. Private sector will be made attractive by facilitating the establishment of retirement benefits, provident fund/pension schemes, disability insurance and insurance for employees with disability and redundant employees. Foreign workers fee system will be introduced to regulate and streamline recruitment of foreign workers in the country.

Strategy: i. Enforcement of Labour and Employment Act and its regulations through awareness and advocacy, development of guidelines and procedures and periodic labour inspection services. ii. Instituting a Social Protection System by developing national social protection policy and reviewing of the national minimum wage and introducing retirement benefits and other social security schemes for the national work force. iii. Introducing insurance scheme for workers who have been disabled and insurance for workers in between jobs (redundancy). iv. Augmenting the administration of foreign workers by improving the foreign workers recruitment procedures and introducing foreign workers fee system. v. Strengthening the capacity of regional employment and labour offices to effectively deliver the services related to labour administration.

Risk Assessment: i. Labour market is dependent on the economic direction of the country which in turn decides overall need of workers in the country???. ii. Manpower and budget constraint in implementing the programme could be a potential risk. iii. There could be also lack of cooperation from employers and employees in implementing and improving the policies and regulations.

Beneficiary: Employees, foreign workers, employers in the public and private sector.

Program Name: Improving the quality of skilled workers Phase: Approved

Justification: Quality of skilled workers is essential for the growth and productivity of the economy. The quality of workers has to be enhanced through appropriate skills training in the technical institutes, where training standards meet the expectations of the labour market demand as well registration and accreditation standards. This programme aims to improve the quality, relevance and competitiveness of TVET graduates and skilled workers in the country in line with industry requirement. To achieve these outcomes, the Bhutan Vocational Qualifications Framework and Quality Assurance System must be implemented. The skill needs of the industries will be captured through the development of National Competency Standards based on which the TVET training programmes will aligned and strengthened, thereby enhancing the quality and relevance of TVET delivery.

Strategy: i. The BVQF will be implemented in close consultation and involvement of relevant stakeholders. Similarly, National Competency Standards and Assessment Resources will be developed and Competency Based Assessments conducted in line with the BVQF by involving field experts from the industries and training providers. ii. The QAS will be strengthened to ensure that TVET providers meets the quality standards required to deliver quality TVET programmes. All the training providers will be registered, monitored and graded based on compliance to the Registration Regulation 2010. Accreditation of training programmes will be implemented to ensure that the training programmes meet the standards set in the Accreditation guidelines. The accredited TVET programmes will be eligible for the National Certification.

Risk Assessment: i. Lack of active participation of stakeholders will impact the overall implementation of BVQF and QAS ii. Lack of budgetary and human resources especially in the TVET institutes will affect the quality of the work

Au Name: MINISTRY OF LABOUR & HUMAN RESOURCES Department: DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES

Program Name: National HRD programme Phase: Approved

Justification: The shortage of skilled and qualified human resources is a continuing challenge the country faces. Investments in building and strengthening necessary human capital at various levels across sectors are crucial. The National HRD policy has been developed with the objective to align the overall HRD plans and policies of different sectors. Similarly, national HRD road map is expected to guide the overall development of human resources in the country in consistent with the economic growth and long-term development goals. This in turn is expected to steer socio-economic development plans and programs and enhance overall productivity in the economy. Although the private and corporate sector is considered an engine of socioeconomic development, the private sector in particular is constrained with qualified and adequate manpower. This program will continue to implement need based HRD programs and services that will generate growth and employment in the sector. Furthermore, this program will support the private sector in carrying out its own HRD planning and implementation.

Strategy: i. Strengthen the management of HRD portfolio for improved planning, coordinating, implementing and monitoring of the National HRD Policy and master plan. ii. Developing and implementing the national HRD master plan in particular for the private and corporate sector. This will provide the strategic overview and coherence in planning and implementing HRD. Furthermore, the Master plan will be continuously monitored and reviewed to ensure that the activities are relevant to changing socio-economic scenarios. iii. Publishing national HRD advisory series on periodic basis to guide and streamline overall HR planning, investment and development for the short and medium term. iv. Continue to diversify and strengthen the TVET training programs to provide relevant vocational and technical skills and knowledge to youth entering the job market.

Risk Assessment: i. Inadequate human resources being provided to the Department to implement the National HRD Policy. This will greatly affect the efficacy of its plans. ii. Inadequate financial resources being provided for timely and effective implementation. iii. Lack of support from HRD implementing agencies, especially the private sector to invest in HR for their staff. iv. The development of the comprehensive and coherent HRD master plan can be jeopardized if the co-operation of key stakeholders in the HR sector is not forthcoming. v. Similarly, there is also the risk that potential trainees may not be willing to participate in the trainings.

CULTURE

Au Name: DRATSANG LHENTSHOG Department: NA

Program Name: Strengthening of Dratshang Phase: Approved

Justification: The objective of the Dratsang is to strengthen spiritual education system from primary till tertiary level in the country. This is to establish a strong foundation grounded on Buddhist values and spiritual practices of our age-old tradition. The construction of Tango Buddhist college was also initiated in the 10th plan primarily to facilitate access to higher Buddhist studies in the country. There are monastic institutions established across the country both at primary and secondary level, but an institution where access to higher level spiritual education was limited. Currently, there are around 4500 students enrolled in monastic institutions that are established across the country. The target is to increase to 5500 students by the end of 11th plan. Monastic institutions are increasingly becoming a primary avenue for the children from the socially and economically disadvantaged groups to access education. In view of this, it is proposed to strengthen monastic institutions to promote Buddhist studies and also facilitate the development of tsamkhangs and meditation centers for the elderly people to continue their spiritual practices and pursuits.

Strategy: i. Improve the academic and hostel facilities of dratsangs, rabdeys, shedras, gomdeys and other monastic institutions which currently have very limited facilities. ii. At the primary education level, improve the nutrition and sanitation in the monastic institutes through financial support. iii. Upgrade existing monastic institutions to accommodate the students graduating from the primary level to improve access to secondary and higher level of Buddhist studies.

Risk Assessment: i. Inadequate financial resources will jeopardize the implementation of plan activities. ii. Inadequate HR both managerial and technical may affect implementation of the programme.

Beneficiary: Monks, nuns, lay persons and general public

Au Name: MINISTRY OF HOME & CULTURAL AFFAIRS Department: DEPARTMENT OF CULTURE

Program Name: Preservation and Promotion of Culture. Phase: Approved

Justification: Preservation and promotion of Bhutan's cultural heritage has always been accorded a high priority on the development agenda and the relevance of culture to development outcomes cannot be underestimated. It is deemed vital for the country's survival and socio-economic progress as it provides a strong basis for building national identity and unity. Bhutanese tradition and culture also plays a vital role in protecting and conserving the country's rich natural environment. It stands as a material and spiritual representation of aspirations, achievements, expressions and expertise of renowned spiritual and historical figures over centuries. The mounting pressure from the forces of globalization has put considerable strain on conservation and promotion efforts. The Department of Culture under the Ministry of Home and Cultural Affairs continuously strives to preserve and promote Bhutan's rich and unique cultural heritage. The long-term objective of the department is to integrate holistically the preservation, promotion and development of the cultural heritage of Bhutan into all areas of sustainable development.

Strategy: i. Inventorying, classification and documentation of tangible cultural heritage. ii. Preservation and promotion of cultural properties and heritage sites. iii. Strengthen institutions responsible for preservation, conservation and promotion of cultural heritage. iv. Development of a strategic cross-cutting plan for preservation and promotion of our cultural heritage.

Risk Assessment: i. The risk foreseen while implementing the planned activities would be the availability of adequate fund and its timely release. ii. It may also be highlighted that inadequate human resources in general and the lack of skilled professionals in the field of conservation in particular might also hamper proper and timely execution of the planned activities.

Beneficiary: All sections of the society, artisans, linguistic, tourism sector, religious institutions/ organizations and minor communities will benefit from this programme.

Program Name: Promotion and Development of the Craft Industry Phase: Approved

Justification: A vibrant & economically sustaining crafts industry is essential for enhancing employment, rural income & economic growth. While there exists promising potential for development of craft industries is Bhutan, the sector could not efficiently harness the potential due to several constraint such as lack of research and development programs, limited access to finance by the craftsmen, limited human resource capability, use of conventional tools, low economy of scale, limited infrastructure and transport facilities, absence of market information and competition from import similar crafts products. In cognizant to above constrains, the Agency for Promotion of Indigenous Craft (APIC) was create during the 10th FYP to steer the craft industry. During the 11th FYP period, the agency will continue its commitment to accelerating the growth and development of the craft industry on a sustainable footing.

Strategy: i. Rigorously promote product innovation and design bank ii. Establish functional craft clusters, iii. Develop and promote business enablers, iv. Strengthen distribution, marketing & product promotions

Risk Assessment: i. Availability of land for construction of permanent craft bazaar ii. Availability of timely and adequate fund. iii. Availability of skilled man power

ENVIRONMENT

Au Name: MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE AND FORESTS Department: DEPARTMENT OF FOREST

Program Name: Sustainable Management of Forest Landscapes and Conservation of Biodiversity Phase: Approved

Justification: With increasing pace for developmental activities across the country, the natural resources are placed under severe pressure. Prioritized developmental activities are takes place increasingly inside the protected areas and critical watersheds. Such pressures, if left unchecked will pose grave threat to the biodiversity resources and will ultimately affect the functioning of the natural system. As a country which displayed excellent track record in the area of environment conservation, nature conservation will continue to be an integral aspect of the Bhutan's development. The management of parks and protected areas which consists of about 51.44% of the total land area would be a major challenge at a time when the country is undergoing rapid economic growth. This program will focus on maintaining a healthy balance between meeting the development needs of the people without undermining or damaging the natural environment.

Strategy: i. The program is strictly designed in-line with the National Forest Policy of 2011. The focus on the program will be on promoting sustainable utilization of the protected area resources for the benefit of the resident communities based on functional zones. ii. Designated core zones of the protected areas will be strictly protected for biodiversity conservation purposes. iii. Innovative interventions based on scientific research will be designed to secure the integrity of the parks and the biological corridors. iv. As a means of linking environmental conservation to development, ecotourism activities will be strongly pursued in the protected areas in close collaboration with the Tourism Council. v. Additionally, the program will, aside from promoting sustainable use of forest resources including NWFPs, design effective interventions to mitigate human wildlife conflict.

Risk Assessment: i. Ownership of natural resources by the local communities. ii. Adverse impact of climate change on the natural systems. iii. Inadequate technical capacity and resources. iv. Over emphasis on economic development over conservation.

Beneficiary: i. Farmers ii. Communities living in and around Pas iii. International communities

Program Name: Sustainable Management of State Forests Phase: Approved

Justification: The Department of Forest and Park Services has over the years tried to maintain a balance between conservation and economic development. The concept of sustainable forest management plays an important role in maintaining the health of the ecosystem and in upholding the constitutional mandate of maintaining a minimum of 60% forest covers for all times to come, without compromising people demand for timer and other forest produce. While Forest Management Units (FMUs) & Working Schemes (WS) cater to the demand of timber for domestic and commercial purpose, the community forest and Non- wood Forest Produce (NWFP) management groups also help in improving the living standards of the rural people through sale of forest produce and non-wood forest produce from their managed area. Going forward, the Department will continue to work toward promoting the sustainable management and utilization of forest and other biodiversity resources for livelihood and economic development.

Strategy: i. Implementation of all the activities will be carried out in coherence with the National Forest Policy, 2011. The Department will start to implement various strategies, road maps and documents developed in the 10th FYP for carrying out the planned interventions of the program. ii. In the interest of ownership and sustainability, the implementation of the activities will be entrusted to the field divisions (Territorial Divisions, Parks, Dzongkhag Forestry Sector) in close collaboration with other relevant stakeholders such as NRDCL. iii. Since most of the activities are co-ordinated at the central level, the central agencies will plan and monitor all the activities in the field. Technical backstopping to the field offices will be provided by the functional divisions.

Risk Assessment: i. Inadequate skilled human resources ii. Timely adequate funding iii. Impact of Climate Change

Beneficiary: i. Farmers ii. Communities living in town and cities iii. Wood based Industries and factories iv. International communities

Program Name: Integrated Watershed Management to ensure Sustainable Environmental Services Phase: Approved

Justification: Well managed watersheds play a pivotal role in supplying a wide range of goods and services both on-site and downstream. They are the basis for sustainable agriculture, forestry and pastoral pursuits, sustaining biodiversity and providing other environmental benefits as well as water for local and downstream use. The production of hydro power for export and internal use, contributes about 24% to Bhutan's GDP and this is expected to rise further with the planned construction of more hydro plants, making electricity generation the single biggest contributor to the economy. Consequently, a reliable supply of quality water is the most valuable commercial product derived from watersheds. It is evident that the maintenance and improvement of the country's watersheds is a high management priority, not only for hydro power, but also for domestic use and irrigation. This program will continue to work toward maintaining environmentally and economically healthy watersheds.

Strategy: i. The program implementation shall pursue a two-pronged approach that will distinguish activities to be carried out on its own at the strategic level, and those activities that must be integrated, incorporated and harmonized into the implementation plans of other area- based development, conservation and management programs within and outside the Ministry. These include the regular development plans of the Dzongkhags and Geogs as well as the land-use specific planning frameworks such as those that apply to FMUs, Pas and CFs. ii. The focus will be on identification and assessment of critical watershed and designing watershed specific interventions. iii. Identify and inventory the significant wetland of Bhutan and promote its conservation through appropriate interventions.

Risk Assessment: i. Environmental protection remains a priority for the Bhutan; ii. Bhutanese economy continue to grow and will remain supportive of the sector initiatives by provisioning adequate resources in achieving the 11th FYP targets; iii. Integrated Watershed management approach is acceptable to concerned agencies.

Beneficiary: i. Farmers (drinking water and irrigation) ii. Residents of town and cities ( drinking water and other uses) iii. Factories and industries ( cooling and other purposes) iv. International communities v. Hydropower companies

Program Name: Enhanced Disaster Preparedness, Response and Relief Capacity. Phase: Approved

Justification: Bhutan is located in one of the most fragile and vulnerable ecosystem in the eastern Himalayas. Increasingly it has witness high frequency and intensity of disaster due to the effect of climate change, emerging socio economic pressure and changing demographic patterns. Bhutan also falls under one of the most seismically active zones (Zone IV and V) in the world. This is evident from the 21st September, 2009 and 18th September 2011 earthquakes, which caused widespread damages in the country. Further, GLOFs is one the most serious potential natural hazard due to the effects of global warming, and rapid glaciers retreats in the Himalayas. Bhutan was hit by GLOF in the past in 1957, 1960, and 1968 and recently in 1994. In view of the above, the DDM proposed to strengthen disaster preparedness, reduce disaster risk and ensure disaster resilient infrastructure development at all levels of the government and community at large.

Strategy: i. Continue to create awareness and inculcate a mindset of disaster prevention, mitigation and preparedness in the pre-disaster phase, ii. Develop effective disaster response capabilities at various levels for post disaster services. Disaster preparedness and response ability at the community level will be strengthen and accord high priority. iii. Efforts to mainstream disaster resilient infrastructure development into the development of policies and plans.

Risk Assessment: Though there is strong political commitment from the government, establishment of disaster management institutes at various levels of the government agencies and Dzongkhags, and preparation of disaster management plan for all 20 Dzongkhags and relevant agencies would be a daunting task for the DDM in the 11th plan. As in the past, enforcement of the plans and delivering emergency response on time would continue to be a challenge in the 11th plan.

Program Name: Conservation and Sustainable Environmental Management Phase: Approved

Justification: With the aim to achieve sustainable development in the country, the activities of the 11 FYP for NEC has been formulated incorporating the urgent needs that should be in place to ensure judicious use of natural resources along with policy and regulatory measures that enable and facilitate this commitment. At present, Bhutan has a pristine environment with 70.46 percent forest coverage and 19,751 square kilometers of land under protected areas and biological corridors but growing population, urbanization, infrastructure expansion and industrialization among many others, place increasing demand of natural resources along with pressure on the state of the environment like air and water quality and land pollution. The commitment to remain carbon neutral and maintain forest cover of 60% at all times to come has becoming increasingly challenging as we open up to meet the new development needs of the country. NEC therefore will continue to support towards strengthening and enforcement of legislations and policies, advocate environment mainstreaming, promote green development, ensure water security, enhance service delivery, thereby ensuring sustainable development and minimize negative impact on environment.

Strategy: i. In order to ensure minimum negative impact on environment from development activities, continued efforts will be made through strengthening of environmental laws and regulations, policies and plans and national capacity. Mainstreaming of environment in the sectoral policies plans and programmes with support from GNHC will be promoted through awareness and capacity building both at the central and local level. ii. Water security will be strengthened through the development of integrated water resource management plan and better coordination. This will be further supported through the enforcement of Water Act and development of water regulation. Further environmental assessment process will be strengthened through establishment of four regional environment offices which also aims to deliver prompt, professional and effective public services.

Risk Assessment: i. In order to effectively carry out these activities, some of the risks foreseen are the sector implementation of the legislation, mainly due to the lack of human resources and capacity at all levels. In addition, one of the biggest risks is the availability of resources to carry out these prioritized activities which is linked to the realization of the SKRAs and NKRAs. ii. Inadequate budget for TA/DA and fuel might hamper effective compliance monitoring and site visits to the field. This was one of the problems encountered in the 10th plan, which hampered carrying out of other activities as well.

Beneficiary: Local households and individuals are expected to have built capacity, immense benefits from sustainable use of natural resources, enjoy clean air and water and ensure water security. At the national level, the successful implementation of the plan will help maintain pristine environment, maintain green house gas emission within sequestration capacity of our forest.

SPORTS

Au Name: BHUTAN OLYMPIC COMMITTEE Department: SECRETARIAT

Program Name: Excellence through sports for all. Phase: Draft

Justification: Sports and games directly or indirectly impact the lives of all citizens, irrespective of age or gender, and have significant potential to contribute positively to the national economy, culture, good governance, international relations, community spirit, overall health of the population and juvenile delinquency, among others. The current situation of a high proportion of youth population, increasing rural-to-urban migration, increasing urbanization and associated lifestyle-related health problems, are challenges of the development process. If not mitigated, such problems can have serious repercussion on society's health, value systems, living environment and the economy. In light of the overwhelming evidence of the benefits of sports and given the present systemic weaknesses, there is a compelling need for a focused and coherent sports development plan that will strategically intervene.

Strategy: i. Establish a robust sport governance system to efficiently deliver organized sports to all. ii. Identify and pursue mechanisms to secure the financial sustainability of development programs and accountability within sports bodies iii. Develop human resource capacity in sports bodies for delivery of services and results iv. Provide opportunities and access to sports facilities by optimizing management and utilization of existing and new sports infrastructure v. Promote a vibrant sporting culture and overall sports development through advocacy and engaging all forms of media and communications vi. Engage all national and international partners and stakeholders through a clear strategic partnership framework.

Risk Assessment: i. Unavailability of land for constructing sports infrastructure ii. Lack of sufficient financial resources may affect the efficacy of the plan. iii. Human Resource capacity within the Bhutan Olympic Committee and stakeholders is limited and without additional HR, the implementation of the plan will be affected. iv. To achieve Sports for all depends on the support of multiple stakeholders. Without their co-operation, the successful implementation of plan is at risk.

Beneficiary: The target population is the public at large, with a special emphasis on the youth.

GOVERNANCE

Au Name: MINISTRY OF FINANCE Department: DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE & CUSTOMS

Program Name: Revenue & Customs Services Phase: Approved

Justification: The Department of Revenue and Customs is primarily responsible for mobilizing internal resources through taxes, royalties and non-tax revenues to cover the expenditures of the RGoB to implement its socio-economic plans and programmes. An optimum tax system is one which stimulates equity and fairness, efficiency, neutrality, simplicity, certainty, flexibility and fiscal adequacy. Evidence suggests that other non-hydro revenue sources are losing ground, reflecting the narrow tax base and generous incentives and exemptions. The modernization of tax and custom administration will help to increase tax collections while simultaneously reducing the cost of collection. One of the key initiatives will be simplifying and rationalizing the tax procedures and developing a web based revenue administration system to maintain, generate and analyze information efficiently for decision making purposes.

Strategy: i. Initiate specific fiscal reforms in the 11th plan in customs administration and compliance. Also rationalize and simplify the tax administration to increase collection and enhance compliance. ii. Develop a web-based system called Revenue Administration and Management Information System (RAMIS) to allow for greater efficiency in maintaining, analyzing and generating information. iii. Facilitate trade activities through supporting Department of Trade in its pursuit of favorable bilateral agreements and appointing necessary trade agents in the entry points. iv. Strengthen institutional and manpower capacity.

Risk Assessment: i. Parliamentary approval needs to be sought for any fiscal policy change. ii. Other external factors influence the collection of taxes from the business enterprises such as the global economic conditions and policies especially monetary policy influences trade, thereby affecting tax collections. iii. Inadequate funds and human resources will affect implementation of plans in a timely manner.

Beneficiary: The Royal Government of Bhutan and its citizens.

Au Name: MINISTRY OF FINANCE Department: DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTS

Program Name: Public Accounts Services Phase: Approved

Justification: The Department of Public Accounts is responsible for ensuring proper accounting of government financial resources and the management of treasury and debt. Prudent utilization and management of public funds requires strengthening of current financial management systems. In particular, the revision of fiscal transfer and monitoring guidelines as well as the implementation of treasury management guidelines are required. Furthermore, the Public expenditure management system has to be integrated with the MYRB, NPPF and RAMIS In its role of mobilizing and managing of government debt, the division of debt management will be strengthened to consolidate all debt management functions. In particular the in-house capacity to conduct analytical tasks including cost and risk analysis of debt and DSA will be strengthened.

Strategy: i. Appropriate fund redistribution mechanism needs to be put in place. Strengthen Multiyear Rolling Budget (MYRB).Treasury Single Account, Government Accounting System and green accounting shall be carried out. ii. Debt contracting responsibility for hydro project currently executed by MoEA to be consolidated with Debt Management Division of MoF. The DMD to be elevated to a Department.

Risk Assessment: i. Challenges in unsupervised transactions, un- reconciled accounts and fund utilization capacities due to weak monitoring and evaluation capacities. ii. Heavy reliance on tax measures to mobilize resources as it is getting harder for Bhutan to avail of loans on account of her moving up the development index.

Au Name: MINISTRY OF FINANCE Department: DEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL BUDGET

Program Name: National Budget Services Phase: Approved

Justification: The Department of National Budget has the responsibility of preparing the multiyear rolling budgets (MYRB) in accordance to the budget manual. The MYRB system which started as a pilot in the 9th Plan makes budget projections for more than one financial year. Minor system modifications will be carried out to make MYRB system more versatile in the 11 FYP through constant revision of formula used in the preparation of recurrent budget and incorporation of additional reports formats. Furthermore, the integration of MYRB with Public Expenditure Management System (PEMS) and Plan Monitoring system (PlaMS) will provide all budgeting agencies with holistic view of their plans, annual budgets and expenditures. As required by the Public Finance Act 2007 and amendment thereof, a multiyear rolling budget i.e. two years' expenditure projections will have to be implemented in the 11 FYP. The National Budget Services will have to ensure efficient and effective allocation and utilization of public resources. This will be implemented through strengthened monitoring and co-ordination of the annual budgets in collaboration with Department of Public Accounts.

Strategy: i. Establish proper linkage between plan and budget - integrating MYRB system with Plan monitoring System (PlaMS) of GNHC to allow for greater efficiencies in reporting and decision making. ii. Implement multi- year rolling budget from the start of 11 FYP as required by the Public Finance Act 2007 and amendment thereof. iii. Provide resource position of the Government so that implementing agencies can plan and re-prioritize with greater certainty about future resource allocations and improve resource allocation to strategic priorities. iv. Gender Responsive Budgeting to advance gender equality and women's empowerment. v. Green budgeting for conservation of environment and the sustainable use of the natural resources.

Risk Assessment: i. Inadequate resources can affect the implementation of activities to develop systems. ii. Gender responsive and green budgeting are new concepts and limited expertise being may challenge the implementation of these activities

Beneficiary: All Central Government and Local Governments agencies including Thromdes and State owned Enterprises.

Au Name: MINISTRY OF FINANCE Department: DEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL PROPERTY

Program Name: National Property Services Phase: Approved

Justification: The Department of National Property (DNP) manages the extensive moveable and immoveable properties owned by RGoB. The DNP also spearheads and manages procurement system of the Government. In order to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness, transparency and accountability and compliance in the government systems, Department of National Property will improve the planning and procurement system in the 11th FYP. These initiatives will make the procurement system more competitive, transparent and efficient leading to competitive prices for goods & services.

Strategy: i. Develop and implement proper planning and e-procurement system ii. Develop and implement government property management system like e-inventory iii. Promote traditional Arts and crafts through diversification of products for use by government agencies. iv. Strengthen PAVA and compensation systems

Risk Assessment: i. Budget being unavailable at the right time could constrain the implementation of plans. ii. Expertise being unavailable to improve PAVA and compensation system could affect the plan. iii. Effective Property management of government properties depends on coordination and co-operation with many government agencies. If this is not forthcoming, it can affect effective implementation of the plan.

Beneficiary: All Central and Local government agencies, Corporate and private sector.

Justification: The Secretariat of Ministry of Finance provides the support services such as administration, finance and human resource management for the departments under the Ministry. Other very specific responsibilities are the monitoring and coordination of the macro-economic situation, the management of internal audit for all government agencies, and Corporate Governance of Public Enterprises. The recent rupee shortage has clearly shown that the management of macroeconomic situation and forecasting needs to strengthened further. Additional sectoral information pertaining to trade, money and banking, tourism, State Owned Enterprises (SOE) needs to be added to the current framework (MTFF) to make macro-fiscal projections more robust. To enhance fiscal and financial accountability and transparency, there is a need to strengthen Internal Audit services to improve performance and pre-empt corruption right from the initial stages. Further, Corporate Governance needs to be strengthened through improved monitoring. This will contribute to increased revenue generation for the government.

Strategy: i. Strengthen Macroeconomic coordination management through the up-gradation of MTTF to Macro-economic Framework (MEF), to provide reliable information and data for policy and decision makers. The MEF will be underpinned by an IT system to allow for greater efficiency and effectiveness. ii. Strengthen Fiscal and Financial accountability and transparency through reviewing and augmenting the structures and responsibilities of Internal Audit Units in Government. iii. Improved analysis and review of performance of State Owned Enterprises through development of an information and performance management system for SOEs.

Risk Assessment: i. The development of various systems depends on co-ordination and cooperation by stakeholders. Lack of coordination and support by stakeholder agencies which will affect the implementation of plans. ii. Limited knowledge and skills to tackle macroeconomic, fiscal and corporate governance issues may affect effective implementation of plans.

Beneficiary: All Government agencies and the economy sector as a whole.

Au Name: MINISTRY OF HOME & CULTURAL AFFAIRS Department: DEPARTMENT OF LOCAL GOVERNANCE

Program Name: Strengthening of Local Governance Phase: Approved

Justification: Good governance plays a key role in the pursuit of Gross National Happiness. With the decentralization of power to the Local Governments (LGs), people's participation in the country's development planning and implementation has been given the highest priority. However, in order for LGs to perform efficiently and effectively, their institutional capacity has to be strengthened. As mandated and done in the 10th plan, the DLG will continue to build capacity of the LG functionaries through series trainings, workshops , seminars and exposure visits both within and outside the country. Various studies are also proposed that will look into finding solutions to recurring problems in the LGs regarding policy and legislations.

Strategy: i. Strengthening the capacity of the LG functionaries is viewed as a foundation of efficiency and effective delivery of public services. In view of this, DLG will continue to build capacity of the LG functionaries in collaboration with other relevant stakeholders. ii. Emphasis will also be put in to improve information management system, participation of female in the LG functionaries, and improving the coordination mechanism with external stakeholders.

Risk Assessment: i. Inadequate financial resources can affect the implementation of activities ii. If sufficient human resources are not provided, it will also affect the timely implementation of activities.

Au Name: MINISTRY OF HOME & CULTURAL AFFAIRS Department: ROYAL BHUTAN POLICE

Program Name: Development of Fire and Rescue Services Phase: Approved

Justification: The Fire Service Department comprises 2 officers and 165 police personnel who cater fire fighting and emergency fire services across the nation. Besides that, they also provide rescue and recovery operations such as road traffic accident, drowning cases and river rescue operations. At present Fire Service Division has 56 fire engines against 165 trained fire personnel stretched over 20 Dzongkhags and 1 rescue vehicle fully equipped with rescue equipment stationed at Thimphu, The Fire Service Division also installed Fire hydrant system in six Dzongs and fire alarm system in three historical Dzongs namely Tashichho dzong, Trongsa Dzong and Punakha Dzong. The trend of fire accidents has been constant at 40 cases for the last three years, however, the service was not up to the mark due to lack of infrastructure and manpower in all the dzongkhags and major towns. Therefore, it is proposed to strengthen fire and rescue services with the establishment of an independent fire service department under MoHCA. The Fire Service Division also provided fire safety trainings to the institutes and public and till date a total of 7992 people have been trained. Such training will be continued in the 11th plan to prevent and curb down the fire incidences in the country.

Strategy: i. Establishment of regional fire brigade with fire stations along with accommodation and other necessary fire equipment in all the dzongkhags. ii. The fire service division will also continue to train institutes and general public on fire safety and rescue services and create awareness among the general public using media such as BBS, Kuensel from time to time. Brochures and pamphlet will also be developed to distribute to the general public.

Risk Assessment: Inadequate fund and lack of manpower might impact the successful implementation of the proposed activities.

Program Name: Development and Reformation of Prison Services Phase: Approved

Justification: The Prison Service Department administers 8 prisons including Youth Development and Rehabilitation Center at Tshimasham. The existing prisons has capacity for 811 prisoners. However, it accommodates 1040 prisoners including 45 female due to increased in number of prisoners. This has led to overcrowding of the prisons which has acceded to many issues such as difficulty in maintaining discipline and security, poor health and hygiene, and increase in conflict and violence in the prison. There is also a difficulty in rehabilitating the prisoners leading to increase in recidivism. Further, it is increasingly realized that the increase in number of prisoners also increases liabilities to the society. The RBP is also constrained many factors such as shortage of manpower, accommodation for prison guards and poor security system and facilities. In view of this, it is proposed to strengthen prison facilities for improved security.

Strategy: i. The Prison Service Department proposes to construct a rehabilitation center at Dolongang with capacity of 500 prisoners to decongest current jails. ii. Adequate accommodation and other facilities for the police personnel will be provided to encourage deliver prompt services. iii. Efforts to re-integrate former convicts into the social mainstream will also be made by introducing rehabilitative programs such as vocational skill development, non-formal education system, counseling programs, etc. to productively engage the prisoners. iv. Provision of adequate security systems in prisons to strengthen security at prisons.

Risk Assessment: Financial constraint and lack of technical capacities in the department might constraint the successful implementation of the constructions. Also the success of the major reform in the management of prisons will depends on the efficiency and effectiveness of the security system.

Beneficiary: Prisoners, their families and public at large

Program Name: Maintenance of Law and Order Phase: Approved

Justification: The Royal Bhutan Police is a law enforcement agency mandated to maintain law and order in the Kingdom and provide security to life and property with quality services to the public. Since its establishment in 1965, the RBP was able to maintain law and order in the country, however with the growing population and urbanization, the crime rate particularly among the youth is increasing almost every year. On the other hand, the RBP is not fully equipped to deal with such crimes with limited infrastructure, facilities and technologies. Therefore, RBP proposed to strengthen its services with better infrastructure facilities, technologies and human resources. This will contribute greatly to maintenance of law and order, reducing and preempting crime particularly among the youth in the country.

Strategy: i. Modernization of policing and crime detection using the appropriate technologies such as CCTV ii. Develop Automated Fingerprint Information System for improved crime detection and conviction iii. Building human resource capacity in new and emerging areas iv. Police outreach services strengthened to provide close monitoring and timely execution of the services

Risk Assessment: i. Budget being unavailable at the right time could constrain the implementation of plans. ii. If adequate and skilled personnel are not available, it will affect the implementation of plans.

Program Name: Strengthening Electoral System and Processes for Vibrant Electoral Democracy Phase: Approved

Justification: Elections play a critical role in enhancing, promoting and fostering growth of electoral democracy and participation of citizens of Bhutan. Sustaining participation in the electoral process is becoming a challenge as evident in the falling voter participation rates. Therefore it is crucial that all citizens including youth are adequately informed and educated to actively engage in electoral and democratic process. In terms of gender representation, women need to be actively encouraged to participate as candidates to allow for better election outcomes. The Parliamentary and Local Government elections of the past have resulted in tremendous learning. Strengthening of the electoral process needs to be undertaken to ensure improving cost effectiveness, efficiency and transparency in the conduct of elections. Also, it should facilitate the participation of all eligible voters with minimum errors and in a cost effective manner.

Strategy: i. To improve the efficiency and effectiveness in the conduct of elections, ICT will be increasingly used as a tool to manage the election process, advocacy and dissemination of results. ii. The Election Commission through construction of its Head Office will strengthen the institution through availability of adequate office space and thereby improve its service delivery. iii. Human Resource Capacities of its staff at the headquarters as well as in the districts will be developed to strengthen the capacities of the ECB.

Risk Assessment: i. Inadequate resources to implement plans in a timely manner ii. Inadequate Human resources iii. Political uncertainties could affect the election schedule

Au Name: ROYAL AUDIT AUTHORITY Department: SECRETARIAT

Program Name: Strengthening Institutional Capacity and Audit Service Delivery Phase: Draft

Justification: In order to deliver its mandates as enshrined in the Constitution and the Audit Act of Bhutan 2006, it is imperative for the RAA to embrace sustained development of core skills and capabilities to carry out its task efficiently and effectively. RAA's core mandate is to produce credible audit reports which inform on the economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the use of public resources. This task of RAA is getting more challenging with greater complexity and expansion in the socioeconomic development activities. In its efforts to gain national and international credibility as the SAI of Bhutan, it must continue to build its organizational capacity and systems. Streamlining its audit procedures by conforming it to QA guidelines and external assurances on the processes of auditing and reporting will be some major measures it will undertake to strengthen the institution and its credibility. Furthermore, investments in building and enhancing the HR and professional expertise in RAA will continue.

Strategy: i. Strengthen the institution by carryout a restructuring process concerning the creation of additional Divisions and investing in HRD for auditors in key priority areas. ii. Enhance co-ordination with key stakeholders such as ACC, OAG through development of co-ordination protocols. iii. Streamline audit procedures and adopting best practices in auditing, plough back feedback from peer reviews and client satisfaction surveys to improve the system. iv. Re-enforce the importance of audit reports for deterring corrupt practices, through advocacy targeting MPs, local government representatives, public and civil servants, and public at large.

Risk Assessment: i. If adequate human and financial resources are not provided, it will hamper the successful implementation of the plan ii. The plan is also dependent on support and co-operation from key stakeholders like ACC, OAG, National Parliament. Without their support, it will be challenging for RAA to achieve all its outcomes.

Au Name: ROYAL CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION Department: SECRETARIAT

Program Name: Strengthening HRD and HR system in the Civil Service Phase: Draft

Justification: The RCSC has been in existence since its establishment in 1982. Today the civil service strength stands at 24,275. Undoubtedly, the civil service has played a pivotal role in the development and modernization of the nation as well as strengthening its security and sovereignty. For most of its existence, the challenge for RCSC has been to pursue the policy of small, compact and efficient Civil Service. In the past, the brightest talent would choose the civil service and continue in the service until their retirement. However, this trend is gradually changing and retaining good and qualified staff is becoming a challenge. Also, optimizing and maximizing the investments made in HR to contribute to nation building and strengthening the civil service is critical. Furthermore, motivating and managing civil servants to perform better and productively for delivering professional and quality services is another challenge. (no strategy/activity for small and compact CS)

Strategy: i. Review and strengthen performance management system to make the civil service system efficient, effective and accountable. This involves enhancing the overall management of recruitment, transfer, promotion and discipline in the civil service. Also, the CSI System will be revamped and updated to ensure timely information for decision making. ii. Develop and implement a strategic HRD master plan for civil servants to augment the management of trainings as a critical investment in HR for improving skills, knowledge and attitudes. In addition, monitor the utilization of acquired knowledge to ensure optimization of HRD investments. iii. Motivate civil servants through institutionalization of a reward and recognition system.

Risk Assessment: i. Budgetary constraints can affect the timely implementation of plans. ii. The implementation of HR development and management plans depends on the support and co-operation of all government agencies and therefore can pose a risk in the timely implementation of plans according to the scope envisaged in the programme.

Au Name: ANTI-CORRUPTION COMMISSION Department: SECRETARIAT

Program Name: Minimize corruption through Education, Prevention and Investigation and strengthen ACC as a strong and credible institution Phase: Approved

Justification: Corruption gravely undermines democratic institutions and the rule of law, retards sustainable economic development, distorts fair business practices and exacerbates poverty. It is also known be to key reasons explaining extreme poverty and underdevelopment prevalent in many countries. Corruption in Bhutan is relatively low and is mostly prevalent in the form of misuse of public resources, abuse of public authority to collusion and fronting in procurement contracts, bribery and tax evasion. As a small country founded on the GNH philosophy, Bhutan cannot afford to have any form of corruption. In an effort to effectively manage and reduce corruption in Bhutan, the Anit-corruption Commission was established in 2005. The commission through the implementation of various initiatives has made significant progress in combating corruption over the past decade. Going forward, the commission will continue its effort in making Bhutan free of corruption.

Strategy: Fighting corruption is a multi -sectoral responsibility and good governance is fundamental to curbing corruption. The ACC will take a lead role firstly by directly participating in prevention, education and investigation; and secondly, the ACC will make every effort to prevent good people from falling prey to unlimited opportunities by way of systemic lapses. Thirdly, the ACC will built partnership with public/private and non-governmental agencies, civil society and public at large to create a strong anti- corruption/culture characterized by intolerance towards corruption.

Risk Assessment: i. Lack of ownership and cooperation by other stakeholders; ii. Lack of political will; iii. Inadequate budget; iv. The Recruitment and retaining professionals; v. Social alienation and victimization of the Investigation Officers and risks to their families and relatives; vi. Lack of Human Resource Management autonomy

Au Name: OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Department: SECRETARIAT

Program Name: Strengthening of the Public Prosecution System Phase: Approved

Justification: Upholding of Rule of Law is a basic tenet of democratic governance. The Office of the Attorney General contributes to this outcome through prosecution of criminal and corruption cases and ensuring the administration of justice without fear, favor and undue delays. The objectives of the Office of the Attorney General in the 11th Five Year Plan is to provide a transparent, efficient, accountable prosecution system in the country. Such a system will immensely contribute in upholding the rule of law and making our society corruption free. The OAG also provides legal counsel and information to Government agencies. To improve the delivery of its services, the OAG needs to invest in improving its case management system making it into a web based IT system. It also needs to strengthen the process of prosecution by developing and adhering to standard protocols. Furthermore, to standardize and allow for consistency in the drafting of laws, a drafting manual is essential. These efforts will contribute to enhance the prosecution works and provide faster and fairer justice to the general public.

Strategy: i. Strengthen the system of prosecution through the development of a prosecution handbook for the prosecutors, which will regulate the code of conduct and ethics of the prosecutors. ii. Pursue ICTization of prosecution case management system to make it more efficient and effective. iii. Augment and standardize the legal drafting process through a developing drafting manual to be used as a national drafting standard of laws for all ministries and agencies. iv. Continue and intensify efforts in educating the public on youth and family related laws.

Risk Assessment: i. Budget constraints may impede the smooth implementation of activities. ii. Lack of personnel in terms of numbers as well as technical expertise will affect the quality and efficiency of OAG's work. iii. Ministries and Agencies may not comply with the drafting guidelines or the prosecution handbook, which may result in the continuation of current challenges of inconsistencies and other issues. iv. Successful outcomes for OAG depends on the collaboration and co-operation with RBP, ACC and also the public at large. This may not be forthcoming and therefore is a definite risk for OAG.

Au Name: NATIONAL STATISTICS BUREAU Department: SECRETARIAT

Program Name: Strengthening Statistics for Development Phase: Approved

Justification: Statistics plays a pivotal role in development planning. They are required for evidence-based decision-making by providing quantitative and objective means for assessing development progress. It also allows planners and policy makers to evaluate the implementation of policies and reforms and supports economic management process and delivery of development services. There is a huge demand for quality statistics and data more so with the introduction of Results Based Management in the Five Year Plans. The NSB shall strengthen statistics for evidence-based development through quality surveys, timely production of national reports, systematic data collection and documentation. NSB shall also develop a National Statistics Act to standardize policy and procedures pertaining to the planning, implementation and management of statistics. This will promote adherence to statistical standards and approaches leading to more reliable/credible data generation.

Strategy: i. Continue to conduct nationwide surveys and disseminate the statistical information widely to allow for evidence based decision making. ii. Strengthen legal and regulatory framework through drafting of statistical legislation and policies, thereby enhancing statistical coordination and standards and leading ultimately to more reliable data generation. iii. Strengthen the human resource capacities of statistical staff to continue to conduct research and improve overall soundness of data generation and analysis. iv. Institute a National Data Bank system through improved cross-sectoral coordination amongst all agencies that carryout out surveys and generate statistical data. This will also facilitate easy access to official statistics. v. Develop environmental statistics and accounting system in line with RGoB's policy of sustainable development.

Risk Assessment: i. The surveys and censuses are often funded by development partners. This raises the risk of future sustainability once assistance from development partners is not forthcoming. ii. The shortage of experts and specialists in statistics especially in new and emerging themes. iii. Dependence on several publications on secondary data which if not developed using credible statistical methods may results in the publications being unreliable. iv. Data collection and generation depends on good co-ordination and co-operation amongst its producers. There is a risk that co-operation with other producers may not always be forthcoming.

Beneficiary: Local and Central government organizations, non-governmental organizations, international agencies, civil society agencies, private and corporate organizations, etc.

Au Name: JUDICIARY Department: SECRETARIAT

Program Name: Effective and Efficient Judicial Services Management Phase: Approved

Justification: In the study done by the Institute of Management Studies in collaboration with the Bhutan National Legal Institute on "Access to Justice in Bhutan" revealed that the human resource development challenge topped the list with 44.1%. The bulk of the needs expressed was in professional development of the court staff at 85.2%. Therefore, capacity development was found imperative for judiciary. In terms of service delivery, the current case management systems are managed manually, thereby making it inefficient, prone to errors and lacking transparency and accountability. This greatly needs to be revamped and made into a system using IT as a tool. Currently, many courts in the country are functioning from inside the Dzong where they are sharing the space with District/Dungkhag administration. Many do not have adequate space and facilities which affects service delivery. Also having separate court houses symbolically promotes the independence of the Judiciary and confidence of people.

Strategy: i. To professionalize the Judiciary, investments in human resources both at professional and management level will be made. Besides long-term and short term training opportunities, the judiciary shall try to build capacities through other platforms like peer exchange programs, on the job trainings, mentoring, institutional linkages etc. ii. Simultaneously, work will be undertaken to ICTize Judicial services. This is in line with the Judiciary's objective to reduce its TAT time for service delivery and make it transparent and effective. This will be developed through extensive consultations with all key stakeholders. iii. Project management teams will be formed with proper authority and responsibility to implement the construction projects. The committee will be well equipped to plan and manage construction project activities.

Risk Assessment i. If sufficient financial resources are not received, it will hamper the delivery of its plans. ii. IT initiatives depend on the access and stability of the OPGW network.

Beneficiary: The public at large, and Government and Corporate agencies.

Au Name: ROYAL INSTITUTE OF LAW Department: NA

Program Name: Institutional development and capacity building of Royal Institute of Law Phase: Approved

Justification: With the significant social, cultural, and economic changes taking place, there is a need to strengthen the judicial system to provide the necessary judicial functions and uphold rule of law which is critical for the development of any country. Recognizing this need, the establishment of a legal institute and research centre was initiated in 2009 to develop and enhance the capacities of legal professionals and expertise. Currently, there is no tertiary education institute that provides legal education. Except for the diploma course in National Law offered by Royal Institute of Management, students have to pursue their legal studies at university level, outside the country. The Royal Institute of Law aims to be an autonomous tertiary level law institute providing undergraduate degree in law. It will also provide for research on development of the legal system in th

Strategy: i. A Strategic Plan/Detailed Project Report will be developed as the first major activity. ii. Based on the DPR faculty recruitment and development, curriculum and teaching materials development and construction of infrastructure for the Law School shall be implemented in tandem and in a phased manner starting from 2013. iii. The Royal Institute of Law will engage both national and international faculties for the law school to form a balanced team of faculty.

Risk Assessment: i. There is a probable risk of not finding capable faculties for the law school once it is established. ii. Ensuring availability of funds to meet expenses of the RIL is a potential risk.

Beneficiary: Judiciary sector and public at large.

Au Name: BHUTAN NATIONAL LEGAL INSTITUTE, ROYAL LAW SCHOOL AND LIBRARY Department: NA

Program Name: Institutional strengthening Phase: Approved

Justification: BNLI is an independent entity established as per the Judicial Service Act 2007. It is mandated to provide continuing legal education to enhance capacity of in-service judicial personnels and others involved in the administration of justice. Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) is considered as most effective mode of settling disputes amicably and maintaining harmony in the society. However, the recent statistics indicates that only few people use this mode of dispute resolution. This is evident from the fact that even petty civil cases are being filed before the courts which requires lot of time and money. It is therefore become very important to revitalize ADR system in our society. With the new form of governance, the right to information and awareness on individual rights and responsibilities has become crucial. Only an informed citizen and transparency of information will lead to successful democratic governance.

Strategy: i. Strengthen advocacy and awareness through legal dissemination programmes. ii. Strengthen and institutionalize Alternate Dispute Resolution iii. Build formal institutional linkage with similar institutes abroad while currently working in close coordination with relevant stakeholders within the country to ensure proper and timely completion of its planned activities. iv. Strengthen Child Justice System

Risk Assessment: i. Bhutan National Legal Institute is currently facing acute shortage of competent professionals to execute its programs. However, to overcome this shortfall, the institute is coordinating with the Judiciary to engage judges to delivers trainings and conduct other programs. The institute is also in the process of grooming its own young professionals in the field of providing continuing legal education and other programs for its targeted beneficiaries. ii. Lack of budget may also delay the implementation as scheduled.

Beneficiary: Bhutanese as a whole.

Au Name: NATIONAL COMMISSION FOR WOMEN & CHILDREN Department: SECRETARIAT

Program Name: Protection and Promotion of the Rights of Women and Children Phase: Approved

Justification: The National Council for Women and Children is the agency tasked with the protection and promotion of the rights of women and children. Currently being at the initial stages of establishing a comprehensive gender mainstreaming and child protection systems, it is imperative to ensure continuance of programmes for a systematic promotion and protection of women and children's rights. As part of Government's commitment to addressing the needs of women and children, increased emphasis needs to be placed on gender mainstreaming and child protection in the 11th FYP. This is also strongly aligned to the National Key Result of Good Governance "Creating a gender friendly environment for women's participation and leadership". Similarly, another key priority will be to ensure that children's right to protection is enhanced as a primary strategy towards addressing their vulnerability. Generation of sex disaggregated data can only lead to better planning and budgeting, thus strengthening the evidences of results. Furthermore, in the process of generating disaggregated data, it will give an explicit picture of the ground realities thus determining state interventions which will be responsive.

Strategy: i. Strengthen inter-agency co-ordination by instituting a monitoring and co-ordination system. In support of this develop a central database for managing and analyzing information better. ii. Enhance Gender mainstreaming through developing a gender indicator handbook to guide all agencies in Gender Mainstreaming, advocacy and incorporation of women empowerment in mainstream education curricula. iii. Augment the legal framework to enhance participation and protection of women and children through review of existing and new legislation from a gender/ child perspective. Furthermore, continue to implement Acts- Child Care and Protection, Child Adoption, Domestic Violence Prevention. iv. Establish support services to enhance participation and protection of women and children. v. Continue advocacy through media and other platforms on the protection and promotion of children and women.

Risk Assessment: i. Shortage of manpower both in terms of numbers and technical capacities of staff to implement the plans. ii. Low level of understanding/ acceptance of gender and child protection issues will impede the smooth implementation of the plans. iii. Inadequate financial resources will affect the implementation of plans. Many of the programmes of NCWC are donor dependent and with many of our development partners phasing out, the continuation of these plans in the future is questionable.

Au Name: GROSS NATIONAL HAPPINESS COMMISSION Department: SECRETARIAT

Program Name: Rural Economic Advancement Programme (Phase II) Phase: Approved

Justification: The Royal Government of Bhutan accorded highest priority in addressing poverty during the 10 Five Year Plan (2008-2013) and continues to do so in its 11th Plan. RGoB also made several international commitments to address the poverty issues such as Decade of Poverty Alleviation (2005-2015), SAARC Development Goals and Millennium Development Goals. Towards this end, targeted poverty initiatives such as Rural Economic Advancement Programme (REAP) and land rehabilitation programme were carried out. While the broad-based development programmes continue to alleviate poverty, the REAP shall seek to target the extreme poverty that may not be adequately addressed through broad-based development programmes. Given the significant contribution of the REAP I to national objectives of poverty reduction, the GNH Commission has decided to upscale the targeted programme in 11th FYP covering the poorest villages across 20 Dzongkhags.

Strategy: i. REAP II shall carry out its interventions at the village level and the poorest villages shall be selected using objective criteria, namely, multi-dimensional poverty index (MPI). To promote participation and address poverty and deprivations in the six dimensions, communities shall prepare respective village development plans (VDP). Furthermore income generating activities shall cover the entire value chain to ensure effective interventions ii. Special activities targeted at the poorest households in the village shall be implemented as they have difficulties capitalizing on the more general interventions. iii. Promote Government and Non- Government participation and partnerships to allow for synergy and complementary in work. iv. Conduct timely monitoring and evaluation, and provide feedback to continuously refine and sharpen the interventions.

Risk Assessment: i. The successful implementation of the REAP depends on the support and cooperation of Dzongkhag and Gewog Administrations who will be the implementing partner. If support is not forthcoming, it will affect the timely and effective implementation of plans. ii. If adequate financial resources are not made available, it will jeopardize the implementation of REAP activities.

Beneficiary: 116 Villages across 20 Dzongkhags

Au Name: NATIONAL LAND COMMISSION Department: SECRETARIAT

Program Name: National Land Services Phase: Approved

Justification: Land is not simply an economic issue but an issue affecting the very livelihoods and welfare of the people to a large extent. As an agrarian country, land plays an important role in uplifting the livelihood and poverty of the majority of Bhuta-nese population. Therefore equal access to and ownership of land will provide strong foundation for inclusive growth and development. Poverty alleviation or economic dynamism - both ends of the spectrum of government priorities are affected by land issues. It will therefore be imperative for Bhutan to strengthen land information management and improve land related services. Similarly, we cannot hope to create a dynamic financial sector or attract foreign investment, if land transaction and allotment procedures are not transparent, reliable and efficient. As such, it is important to streamline and strengthen land administration and management system of Bhutan

Strategy: i. Improve and strengthen land registration and transaction services ii. Improve multipurpose cadastre information iii. Develop and establish geo-spatial infrastructure iv. Carry out high precision surveys on geodetic and geodynamic applications v. Improve and strengthen cadastral database

Risk Assessment: i. Lack of adequately trained/skilled manpower ii. Shortage of competent and reliable employees in the Dzongkhags and Drungkhags iii. Lack of active participation from stakeholders in realizing the benefit of multi cadastre information

Beneficiary: The Commission, the Secretariat, Royal Government, business and general public at large.
