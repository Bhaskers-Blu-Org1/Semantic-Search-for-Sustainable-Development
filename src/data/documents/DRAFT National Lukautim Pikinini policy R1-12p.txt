Foreword

As Minister for Community Development; Youth and Religion it is my great pleasure to bring forward this National Lukautim Pikinini (Child Protection) Policy. This document sets the Government's key commitments to protect children and young people of Papua New Guinea from all forms of violence, abuse, exploitation and neglect. It is rooted in our determination to make Papua New Guinea a safe and secure place to be a child. Our vision is to protect children and secure the future of this nation.

Children are important present and future assets for Papua New Guinea. The age from birth to 18 is not only a time for great potential and opportunity but also a time of great vulnerability, during which all those involved in the protection, development and survival aspects of children's lives must work together in children's best interests.

The ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) commits the Government of to protect children from all forms of harm, abuse, and exploitation. The Government's aim is to invest adequately in all aspects of children's programmes with positive hope for a better future for the country. The absence of a framework for this has been a huge gap for programme planning and budgeting.

The development of the National Lukautim Pikinini Policy is a significant milestone in achieving this under the auspice of the Ministry for Community Development, Youth and Religion. The Policy is aligned with the priorities of the country's Vision 2050, the Development Strategic Plan 2010-2020 and the Medium Term Development Plan 2015-2018.

I am privileged to be a part of this Government and it is an honour to head this Ministry and be part of the legislative reforms on family and children and the new direction set by this Policy. I acknowledge and appreciate the spirit of real partnership in the review of the Lukautim Pikinini (Child) Act 2015 (LPA) and the development of this Policy.

I commend the LPA Review team comprising of representatives from the Constitutional and Law Reform Commission, the Department of Justice and Attorney General, the Office of the First Legislative Counsel, Public Solicitor's Office and technical officers from the Department of National Planning and Monitoring, Magisterial Services, the Department of National Executive Council & Prime Minister and of course the team of technical officers and advisors from my Department for a job well done.

I also acknowledge the former Minister, Hon. Loujaya Kouza MP, and the technical officers for the work done in child protection in all sector agencies that has culminated in the production of this Policy. Finally, I am grateful to UNICEF for providing technical support and financial assistance towards child protection programmes in Papua New Guinea.

Honourable Delilah Gore, MP

Minister for Community Development, Youth and Religion Foreword

Preface

The National Lukautim Pikinini (Child Protection) Policy is an umbrella policy that will give overall direction and guidance for a coordinated approach to promoting and protecting the rights and well-being of all children in Papua New Guinea. It also provides the overall policy framework for the formulation and enforcement of the Lukautim Pikinini (Child) Act 2015 (LPA) and gives effect to the review of other family and children's legislation.

This Policy gives prominence to the rights and well-being of children by elevating the status of the Office of Director - Lukautim Pikinini from a branch to a stand-alone office status with the name changed to the Office of Child and Family Services. The direction taken is a progressive pathway for promoting effective planning, budgeting, implementation, and monitoring of children's programmes and services.

The Department for Community Development and Religion is committed to ensuring all mechanisms for Children and Family Services specified in the Policy and subsequently mandated in the LPA are established, resourced, and fully operationalised at the National, Provincial, and District levels.

We cannot deny that the welfare system, after Independence, has deteriorated due to neglect as a result of the lack of adequate annual budget support, inappropriate administrative structure, and the lack of human resource capacity throughout the country.

As Papua New Guinea progresses into the 21st century with an increased level of economic and social activities, issues affecting children will also become overwhelming; improvement of the mechanisms is urgent to adequately address the issues.

The Policy spells out clear responsibilities for every partner in Government, the private sector, development partners, civil society organisations, churches, and families. I encourage cross-sectoral and integrated approaches from all partners to effectively implement the Policy strategies.

Executive Summary

This National Lukautim Pikinini (Child Protection) Policy is consistent with the review of the Lukautim Pikinini (Child) Act 2015 to address child protection and general family welfare services in Papua New Guinea (PNG). The Policy is also consistent with the reforms and development of national and sector policies, legislation and plans such as the Education Act 1983 and the National Education Policy and Plan, and aligns with the National Goals of the PNG Constitution, and priority areas of the Vision 2050, PNG Development Strategic Plan and Medium Term Development Plan that emphasise integral human development and the protection of children.

The PNG national goals and priorities formed the basis for the development of the vision, mission, goals and objectives of the Policy and these are reflected in the Guiding Principles outlined in Chapter 2.

The Policy also directs organisational changes in the structure and the management in the Office of the Child and Family Welfare Services from the national level down to the District level. This includes establishing Child and Family Welfare Services Councils at the national and provincial levels and committees at the district level.

The current Office of the Director for Child Welfare has done its best to execute its mandated administrative and statutory functions. Administratively, the Office provided coordination in the areas of policy and legislation development, capacity building, research and planning to ensure the needs of all children, including the protection of vulnerable children are adequately addressed. The Office also executed its statutory functions in dealing with the range of child protection and family welfare issues including custody, maintenance, adoption and foster care, child abuse and marriage counselling etc. However, the Office struggles to respond to child and family welfare issues due to limited resources, lack of capacity, lack of a coordinated effort between national government and local level governments, as well as private sector agencies and community groups. This policy provides strategies for addressing these critical challenges.

The policy recognises that the development process in PNG has contributed to rapid urbanisation and increased rural to urban population migration causing a rise in social problems including serious child protection and welfare matters. Child protection issues are becoming complex, as analysed in Chapter 3 and Chapter 4.

The Policy further recognises relevant stakeholders as important partners and provides clear direction and responsibilities to each stakeholder. Chapter 5 sets out specific action areas and strategies for implementation while Chapter 6 provides clear responsibilities of the relevant stakeholders. The strategies provide for comprehensive government intervention in strong partnership with all relevant partners to adequately address children's protection at all levels and to create a better future for Papua New Guinean children. The National Lukautim Pikinini (Child Protection) Policy will require a consistent and strong public-private partnership (PPP) for its effective implementation in the next five years.

Executive Summary

1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this National Lukautim Pikinini (Child Protection) Policy (NLPP) is to provide an overarching guide to promote, protect and care for all children in Papua New Guinea (PNG), in the context of implementing the following instruments:

• Universal Declaration of Human Rights

• Conventions on the Rights of the Child (CRC)

• Papua New Guinea National Constitution

• Lukautim Pikinini Act (LPA) 2015

The NLPP also aligns with the following global Sustainable Development goals (SDGs):

• Goal 5.1 End all forms of discrimination against all women and girls everywhere.

• Goal 5.2 Eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres, including trafficking and sexual and other types of exploitation.

• Goal 5.3 Eliminate all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation.

• Goal 16.2 End abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against and torture of children.

This NLPP is designed to benefit all children and families in PNG. It serves as a guide for child protection stakeholders, including national, provincial, district, and local level governments (LLG); civil society organisations; non-governmental organisations (NGOs); development partners; faith-based organisations (FBOs); the private sector and community members involved in planning, financing, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of child protection programmes.

1.2 Policy development process

The NLPP was developed through input from a number of sources.

• Workshops at the national and provincial level with stakeholders from Government, FBOs, NGOs, development partners and child protection service providers.

• Input from meetings of the Lukautim Pikinini Act review team.

• The 2010 Preliminary Audit of Child and Family Support Services.

• Review of international conventions and PNG legislation, national plans, and sector policies.

• Review of international best practice modelling of child protection systems and interventions.

1.3 Definitions

The National Lukautim Pikinini (Child Protection) Policy has adopted the definitions set out below to clarify the meaning and scope of key terms used throughout this document

• Child: an individual between the ages of 0-18 years.

• Child in need of protection: a child who is at risk or suffering from violence, abuse, exploitation, neglect, or who is disadvantaged.

• Child with special needs: a child who is physically and mentally impaired and is disadvantaged and/or is at risk of being vulnerable.

• Family: 'Family' is defined in its widest sense, including parents, those acting in loco parentis, siblings, grandparents and extended family members. It recognises the complexity of contemporary family structures.

• Parents: 'Parent' or 'parents' are defined as a person or persons with parental authority or responsibility. Parenting refers to all roles undertaken by parents or others acting in loco parentis in order to bring up children.

Introduction

2.1 Vision

"Protect Children, Secure Future"

2.2 Outcomes

All children in PNG will grow up in a safe and nurturing family and community environment free from all forms of violence, abuse, exploitation and neglect, and reach their full potential.

The NLPP specifically aims to achieve the following principal outcomes for children.

• Children are safe from all forms of violence, abuse and exploitation.

• Children who have been abused receive services that enhance their recovery and well-being.

• Children's family and community connections are preserved.

2.3 Outputs

There are six outputs to be achieved by 2025:

1

The PNG Whole-of-Government legal and policy framework for protecting children is in place with fully operational core regulatory frameworks, standards, protocols, and implementation plans.

2

Child protection system coordination and leadership at all levels of Government - national, provincial, district and local - is improved.

3

A diverse funding base that is adequate and responsive to meet the needs of children and families is available.

4

A skilled child protection workforce, including child protection volunteers, is in place and adequate throughout the child protection system to meet the needs at all levels of intervention - national, provincial, district and local - available.

5

Access to and quality of primary, secondary, and tertiary child and family services is improved, and referral and case management systems enhanced.

6

A national Child Protection Information Management System is in place and functional to accurately record and analyse data to inform child protection policy and programming.

Policy Statement

2.4 Guiding principles

1 Best interest of the child

The best interest of the child will be the primary consideration in all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, or public or private child and family institutions and organisations.

2 PNG ways

Interventions with children and families will support family and communal values and rights and responsibilities that nurture and nourish good practices of child care and protection and empower families and communities to take action. This principle holds unless it contravenes the principle of the best interests of the child.

3 Integrated services to enforce child rights

Child protection and social protection services will be integrated to create a proactive environment that enforces the rights of children as set out in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).

4 Justice, equity, and non-discrimination

Laws, policies and programmes for children in need of protection will align with the PNG Constitution and international instruments to which the PNG Government is a signatory and enable the equitable distribution of resources to eliminate gender, social, cultural, urban/rural disparities and the delivery of services in a manner that promotes non-discrimination, tolerance, respect for diversity, and inclusiveness.

5 Participation

Processes are in place through which duty bearers and rights holders, especially children, are consulted and enabled to participate in planning, implementation, and monitoring of programmes and services.

6 Accessibility, transparency, and accountability

Protection services are accessible to all children in need of protection with priority for the most vulnerable children; barriers to access addressed; interventions that are financially viable, cost efficient, and effective; accountability and transparency at all levels.

7 Partnerships

Diversified partnerships are entered into with institutions, between specialists and institutions, between professionals and beneficiaries within a participatory framework with clearly defined rights and obligation.

Papua New Guinea

3.1 Background

PNG is the biggest and most populated Pacific Island nation with an estimated population of around 7.6 million, of which about 49 per cent are children between the ages of 0-18 years. This figure is expected to reach just over 10 million by 2030.

During the last 10 years, strong growth in PNG's mining and resource sector has led to PNG becoming the sixth fastest-growing economy in the world. Sustained economic growth has provided improved budgetary conditions in PNG. More investment, particularly in the areas of education and health, is increasingly contributing to improved service delivery for children and their families. At the same time poverty, crime, and growing social disparity continue to affect children. Investment in protection services remains extremely limited and access to services is poor.

This Chapter looks at the protection needs of children in PNG.

3.2 Children's exposure to violence

There is no nationally representative data on violence against children in PNG. Small-scale studies consistently demonstrate that the safety, well-being, and opportunities for the development of significant numbers of children in PNG are affected by exposure to high levels of violence in family, community, and institutional settings. Around 80 per cent experience verbal abuse.1 General lawlessness contributed to around 50 per cent of children feeling unsafe in their communities at night. Eighty-five per cent of men reported that they beat their children.2 Twenty-nine per cent of children were beaten at least once a week by male family members.3 A study in 2011 shows that between 49 to 74 per cent of survivors who come to Family Support Centres throughout the country are children under 18 years.4 Available evidence from a domestic violence shelter (House Ruth) in Port Moresby also showed that 60 per cent of children who come to the shelter with their abused mothers had been abused as well.5

1

On the other hand many more children grow up witnessing family and sexual violence and experiencing its negative effects. A 2001 UN study found that 75 per cent of children grow up witnessing physical violence between family members.6

Children who witness or experience violence are significantly more at risk of health problems, anxiety disorders, poor school performance, and future violent and criminal behaviour. Violence does not only affect children as individuals, but it also contributes to the impoverishment of communities and the entire nation. It is a threat to national development and the effort to reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDG).7 It is difficult to achieve universal primary education when children feel it is unsafe to attend and remain in school. The spread of HIV and AIDS is difficult to halt until violence against children and women is reduced and ultimately stopped.

Although no specific economic studies have been conducted in PNG, a recent study on the economic burden of childhood violence in East Asia and Pacific Region indicates that child maltreatment has significant national economic impact, estimated at 2 per cent of GDP per year. A 2014 World Bank study analysing the economic cost of crime, including the cost of family and sexual violence, indicated that high rates of crime and violence have substantial consequences affecting business decision making and constraining investment in PNG.8

Investments in evidence-based interventions, such as strengthening the economic status of families, preventing violence within and outside households, rescuing children from exploitive labour situations, and providing adequate quality of care for survivors are associated with reduced mortality, improved physical growth, less grade repetition, increased school completion, decreased future criminal activity, less drug use or abuse, fewer teen pregnancies, and higher earning potential.9 Investments in early child care and developmental protection can mitigate the deleterious impact of violence, abuse, exploitation and neglect, ultimately resulting in long-lasting gains that benefit children and youth, families, communities, and the nation.

3.3 Child marriage

The UNICEF 2013 State of the World Children Report estimated about 21 per cent of women aged 20-24 years in PNG were married by the age of 18 years and 2 per cent were married before the age of 15 years.

Customary and traditional practices permit the marriage of girls as young as 12 even10 though the legal age of marriage for girls has been 16 years, and 14 years with the consent of parents and the court. The LPA (2015) raises the age of marriage for both boys and girls to 18 years.

Early marriage significantly heightens the vulnerability of children. Child brides are more likely than unmarried girls to die younger, suffer from health problems, live in poverty and remain illiterate. Child brides almost always bear children before they are physically and emotionally ready. Premature child birth can lead to a variety of health problems for mothers including fistula.11 Child brides are often removed from school and denied further education making it difficult for them to gain employment. Child brides are at increased risk of physical, sexual and psychological violence from their husbands than other women who marry later. They are also often less able to seek legal or psychosocial support from their family or the relevant service providers.12

3.4 Child labour

Children in PNG continue to engage in the worst forms of child labour, particularly in forced domestic service and commercial sexual exploitation. Cases of child sexual exploitation have been observed in towns and in the vicinity of mines, logging operations, fisheries and other sites of resource exploitation or large-scale construction. Some children working in domestic service are held in indentured servitude in order to pay off family debts. These children work long hours, lack freedom of mobility, do not have access to medical treatment, and do not attend school. PNG does not have a comprehensive list of hazardous occupations from which children are prohibited. Additionally, PNG child labour laws are not effectively enforced, and the lack of compulsory education may increase the risk of children's involvement in the worst forms of child labour.

3.5 Street children

There are no national studies of street children in PNG. There is, however, visible evidence that the problem is on the rise, particularly in major urban centres such as Port Moresby, Mount Hagen and Lae, as well as in smaller towns and settlements. Many of these children are forced onto the street by poverty, disability, lack of parental control, family conflicts, broken or unstable homes, being orphaned, juvenile delinquency, domestic violence, parental abuse and increasing rural-urban migration.

Children are on the street for either their own survival or to earn a living to support their families.

Children on the streets experience poor health, are deprived of their right to education, among other rights, and prone to all forms of violence, abuse and exploitation. While the majority of them are not homeless, there are a few who live on the street in unhygienic environments eating unhygienic foods putting them at high risk of contracting diseases. Other challenges experienced by street children include lack of shelter, clothing, access to healthcare services, drug abuse and vocational and life-skills training. While there are NGOs supporting street children, the available interventions are inadequate and few of those services are directed at supporting families to take care of their children.

3.6 Children in contact with the law

A number of studies, and the PNG government's initial report to the Committee on the Rights of the Child13 and those from the Human Rights Watch14 give some insights into the situation of children that are in contact with the law in PNG. Evidence from these reports shows that children accused of offences too frequently become victims of violence. They are often detained with adults in prisons and detention centres that are overcrowded and lack proper sanitation and hygiene, due to the lack of separate facilities and an inadequately functioning diversion system. Despite the existence of rights-based legislative frameworks which specify that detention of juveniles should only occur for three categories of serious and violent offences, few children have access to diversionary alternatives. PNG Correctional Services statistics suggest that 49 per cent of all juvenile inmates are detained at pre-trial stage, often with adults, and rarely with adequate access to legal or medical support, or independent and transparent oversight of their treatment.15 The majority of these detentions are for divertible offences. Arrested children are frequently denied bail because police are unable to locate parents, citing transport and communication constraints. There is also a paucity of trained Juvenile Court Officers to facilitate family contact. Remand is overused by magistrates; around 65 per cent of juveniles that entered Correctional Services facilities were detained on remand.

3.7 Child protection in emergencies

PNG is prone to natural disasters ranging from rising sea levels and tidal waves in coastal areas to major earthquakes, landslides, floods, volcanic eruptions, and drought in various locations in the country.

PNG is also troubled with constant civil unrest among local ethnic groups and inter- tribal conflicts, resulting in the destruction to families, homes, livelihoods and displaced communities. Disaster and conflict exacerbates children's vulnerability to high levels of violence, abuse, exploitation, and neglect. The child protection system's capacity to prevent and respond to child protection in emergencies is limited.

3.8 Children with special needs

There is no nationally reliable study on disability. Evidence from localised studies suggests that between 7-10 per cent,16 of the population experience some form of disability. Data extrapolated from one of these localised studies suggests that there may be up to 250,00017 children with disabilities throughout the country. Children with visual, hearing and speech impairment, and other physical and mental disabilities are among the most vulnerable and disadvantaged population in PNG. People with disabilities in PNG, including children, have limited access to education due to problems related to transport and mobility, a less disability-friendly school infrastructure and a lack of teachers with appropriate knowledge and skills. The level of unemployment among persons with disabilities is higher than among those without disability. Individuals with mental or emotional impairments are less likely to participate socially than those with other types of impairments. Global evidence shows that children with disabilities often lack basic health care and are at great risk of experiencing physical and psychological abuse and sexual exploitation.

3.9 Child trafficking and smuggling

Child trafficking, which involves in-country, cross border and international movement of children for the purpose of sexual exploitation, child labour, domestic servitude, and other types of exploitation, is significant but under reported. Some children are recruited as cheap labour in bars and restaurants in the main cities and towns.

3.10 Child prostitution

Commercial sexual exploitation of children, mostly girls under the age of 18 years, is an emerging child protection concern in the country. Young women, girls and boys are used for sexual activities in exchange for goods and services, mostly offered by adult males, at mining sites, logging sites, big industrial sites, night clubs in main cities and towns, fisheries, and hotel industries. These children are exposed to abuse, risk of infectious diseases, and unwanted pregnancies. In 1994, The Institute of Medical

Research found that 30 per cent of 350 sex workers interviewed were between 13 and 19 years of age; some were as young as 11 years.18 In 2004, research by World Vision in Port Moresby found that 35 per cent of sex workers are aged between14-24. They also found that 100 per cent of these girls reported taking alcohol or other drugs.19

3.11 Child pornography

Growing access to information and communication technologies such as television, video, video games, mobile phones, and the Internet is influencing many aspects of PNG's economic and social life. They are contributing to the growth of the economy and are increasing the pace of change in society. While their impact on children and childhood in PNG is unexplored, their advent, particularly mobile phones and internet access, has brought with it new threats to children's and young people's health and safety, including increased risk and prevalence of pornography and exposure to paedophile rings. Parental responsibility is vital for safeguarding children from online abuse and exploitation. Censorship of pornographic and illicit materials should be fully enforced to preserve the value and dignities of children.

3.12 Customary and harmful cultural practices

Traditional beliefs, cultures and customary practices have been widely accepted as norms and social obligation in the lives of people. While there are customary practices and beliefs that do not place children at risk, there are practices that do. Skin cutting, tattooing, restriction of certain nutritional food, going without or taking limited amounts of water, isolation from parents, head shaping, nose and ear piercing, accusations of sorcery and the punishment may cause children physical and emotional harm. At present, there is no clarity about which customary practices can be maintained and which should be stopped to protect children.

3.13 Children without birth registration

Existing national legal frameworks including the LPA (2015), the Juvenile Justice Act (2014) and the Family Protection Act (2014) outline a number of rights that children can claim; however, for this to work effectively, it is essential to know who these children are. In 2007 it was estimated that only around 15 per cent of children have their births registered nationally.

18

Registration rates are highest in the National Capital District.20 Birth registration assists children to establish their age. Birth certificates can reduce the chance of children becoming exploited for harmful child labour, or from receiving the same treatment as adults when they come into conflict with the law. Birth certificates can protect children from entering the armed forces before the legal age, or from early marriage, and can assist children to be reunited with family in the event of separation during emergencies or other circumstances.

3.14 Parental incapacities

Many parents, in particular parents with disabilities, unemployed parents, broken families, and other parents without adequate support networks, struggle to provide adequate care and support to their children. This often renders their children vulnerable to violence, abuse, exploitation, and neglect.

Situational Analysis of the Child Protection System in Papua New Guinea

4.1 The child protection system

A system is a set of integrated frameworks, structures and processes that are aimed at achieving an outcome. The outcome of the child protection system in PNG is that:

All children in PNG grow up in a safe and nurturing family and community environment free from all forms of violence, abuse, exploitation neglect and reach their full potential.

The elements and relationships of the PNG child protection system are pictured below.

Continuum of services (Primary, secondary, tertiary) Protect children, secure future Process of care (Early detection, referral and case management systems)

Accountability and evidence base (Data collection, monitoring, research)

4.2 Situational analysis of the child protection system 4.2.1 The legislative and regulatory framework

The LPA (2015) provides PNG with a solid best practice legal and regulatory framework as the basis for a national child protection system. The LPA 2015 establishes strong management, delivery and accountability structures at national, provincial and district levels; clear legal remedies for children in need of protection and their families; and a system of penalties for breaches of the Act.

4

The critical issue to be addressed is the review of other Acts which have an impact on the well-being of children as described under the LPA. Many of these Acts have not been reviewed in several decades and no longer reflect international best practice.

In the area of operationalising instruments - policies, protocols, programmes etc. - the overarching critical need is for all Government partners with mandated responsibility for taking action under the LPA (2015) to amend existing operationalising instruments that will facilitate this.

The 2010 Child Protection System Capacity Analysis identifies specific changes that could be made to 10 Acts and their operationalising instruments. For example, in keeping with international practice, it is strongly suggested that the Juvenile Justice Act be amended to only address children aged 10 years and older, and that any child in conflict with the law under 10 years of age be addressed by the LPA. The Deserted Wives and Children Act should be amended to include a provision that requires that a Child Protection Safety Assessment be conducted prior to finalising custody in these situations and that a Care Plan be developed where concerns are raised. The Marriage Act should be amended to make the marriageable age consistent for both customary and formal marriage.

There is also a need for increasing public awareness of the LPA 2015 and its impact on the day-to-day lives of children and families.

4.2.2 Structures and coordination mechanism

The LPA 2015 ushers in major change to respond to children in need of protection in PNG. Transformation of this magnitude requires a period during which it is empowered and championed at the highest level to secure necessary change to legislation, policy, programmes, monitoring and resourcing across Government partners under the Act if it is to achieve its objectives.

The 2010 Child Protection System Capacity Analysis found that the present level of staffing and division of roles and responsibilities in the Office of Lukautim Pikinini is inadequate to meet the demands of an Act such as the LPA with far-reaching changes to be implemented in policy and programmes and coordination and monitoring of a whole-of-government response.

The LPA 2015 addresses these barriers by proposing the establishment of an independent Child and Family Services Office and Child and Family Services Councils at National, Provincial and District level involving senior

Government officials from the police, health, magisterial services, education, community-based corrections, correctional services, labour and employment, village courts, NGOs and FBOs.

4.2.3 Capacities

4.2.3.1 Financial capacity

There is a strong business case to increase investment in prevention and response to child abuse and exploitation. The economic burden of violence, abuse, exploitation, and neglect of children is significant. Estimates of violence against children in PNG are not available due to the lack of a reliable and nationally representative study on the prevalence of all forms of violence against children. However, evidence from other countries in the East Asia and Pacific region show that child maltreatment costs 2 per cent of the region's GDP, totalling between $150 billion to $160 billion.21

The 2010 Capacity Assessment found that a lack of financial resourcing adequate to fully operationalise the provisions in the LPA and related Acts remains a significant barrier that affects all elements of the national child protection system and hinders the realisation of children's rights to protection. Currently, funding for child protection programmes relies largely on civil society and a few development partners. Government investment in child protection across all Government departments, including the current Office of Lukautim Pikinini, is extremely limited. The bulk of the funding that is available is allocated for human resources, with little left for programming.

In order to make any real progress in ensuring that the nation's children are protected from all forms of violence, abuse, and neglect there is a need for a significant increase in investment for child protection. Therefore, this child protection policy calls for a significant increase in financial investment in child protection.

4.2.3.2 Human resources

Building adequate and effective workforce continues to be a key challenge for Government departments and child welfare agencies across the country. There are insufficient numbers of child protection or welfare workers employed across all relevant Government departments and other key actors at national, provincial, district, and local levels.

The 2010 Child Protection Sector Capacity Assessment Report suggested that as a minimum the child protection human resource needed is:

• One Senior Child Protection Officer for each province (22).

• One Child Protection Officer for each district (89).

• One Child Protection Officer for each LLG (304).

• Five Community Child Protection Volunteers in each LLG (1,520).

While there are only a few social work training institutions, there is no single specialised training on child protection either at certificate, diploma, or degree level. Nor are there comprehensive initiatives to provide training to ensure that current practitioners, both in Government and civil society, maintain up-to-date skills. Both these levels of training must be addressed to ensure that child protection workers across the system and community volunteers are able to access appropriate levels of training delivered at least at the provincial level.

4.2.4 Continuum of services and process of care

There are three levels at which interventions can be made to strengthen a child protection system and address barriers to effectiveness:

• Primary (or universal) interventions are those that target whole communities or all families in order to build public resources and attend to the social factors that contribute to children being in need of protection.

• Secondary or targeted interventions focus on vulnerable families or children and young people, that is, those with special needs or those who are in need of greater support.

• Tertiary interventions target families in which serious abuse/neglect has occurred and aim to reduce the long-term impact of this and prevent it recurring. They include statutory care and protection services.

PNG has made notable progress in establishing a range of core responsive protection services, such as Family Support Centres, Police Family Sexual Violence Units, and Police Sexual Offence Squads, as well as emergency shelters and safe houses run by NGOs. Few organisations are undertaking child victim and witness support programmes at court level. However, the scope and coverage of these interventions remains limited and poorly coordinated.

Also, the 2010 Preliminary Audit of Child and Family Support Services found that generally, there are few child and family services and the majority of these are established at the provincial level and not at the district level, which means access to them is usually very limited. In the process of care, systems for early detection, referral and case management remain weak. This policy calls for improving both access and quality of services as well as strengthening systems for early detection, referral and case management.

4.2.5 Accountability

The child protection system in PNG is characterised by a lack of accurate information on all necessary aspects of child care and protection, including on extent and nature of child protection problems, potential risks, protective factors, and programmatic responses. There are neither monitoring systems for tracking child protection issues, nor standardised core national indicators for data collection. The databases that do exist are rarely functional. There is very little coordination between institutions at national, provincial, and district level, making poor information sharing and networking inevitable. The number of staff assigned to data collection, analysis, and reporting is inadequate. They are inadequately trained, thus leading to poor quality of information at all levels. In addition, there is no one agency designated as responsible for child protection data collection and analysis. Hence the information is often scattered across different sectors. The LPA 2015 aims for the establishment of a Child Protection Register which will go a long way to addressing this gap.

Strategic Priorities
