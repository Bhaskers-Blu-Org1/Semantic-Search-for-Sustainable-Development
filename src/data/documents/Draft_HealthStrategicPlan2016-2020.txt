1. KEY FEATURES OF HEALTH STRATEGIC PLAN

1.1

I

NTRODUCTION

The Ministry of Health (MoH) produced and implemented the first "Master Plan for Health Development 1994-1996" right after the national General Election in 1993, followed by the introduction of "Policy Guidelines for Strengthening District Health System". The former provides strategic direction for rehabilitating and developing the health system in post-conflict setting. The latter laid out a policy framework for embarking the health sector reform in 1995.

The two documents were then used to guide the development of numerous specific health policies, strategic plans, and technical guidelines, notably Health Coverage Plan 1995 (HCP), Health Financing Charter 1996, Health Workforce Development Plan 1996-2006, and Guidelines for Strengthening Operational Districts 1998. The HCP is a framework for re-structuring the health system organization and supporting operations of newly revised roles and functions at each level of the health system, while the Charter paved the way for piloted experimentation of both supply-side and demand-side financing interventions over the last three decades.

The Health Strategic Plan 2016-2020 (HSP3) is the third medium term plan of the health sector. The second (2008-2015, HSP2) and the first plan (2003-2007) were launched at the Annual National Health Congress and Joint Annual Performance Review in 2003 and 2007, respectively. The plan was translated into action through the development and the implementation of Annual Operational plans (AoP) supported by annual budget plan across the health system. The MoH and Health Partners through Joint Annual Performance Review regularly monitored the progress of the plan implementation.

A Mid-Term Review of the HSP2 was conducted by independent consultant team in 2011 and informed by the results of Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey 2010 (CDHS). Results of CDHS 2014 provided hard evidences supporting the final evaluation of the outcome of the HSP2 interventions, especially to assess the progress toward achieving health-related CMDGs, which were adopted as the HSP2 goals. Furthermore the survey findings, to some extent, provided analytical tool for setting priority interventions and agenda for action over the next five years.

1.2

RATIONALE

The

successful implementation

of the HSP3 will be dependent not only on its

structure

and content  but also a clearly outlined implementation process. In this regard, the HSP3 needs to be:

 First, soundly formulated with clearly defined goals, objectives, strategies, outcomes and time horizon, by engaging all concerned stakeholders across all levels in and outside the health system;

 Second, strongly supported by politics, mandates, legislations, and adequately financed, first and the foremost by the RGC with contribution of Development Partners;

 Third, widely communicated and better understood by all actors (including public and private sector, the Government's ministries and agencies, sub-national level administrations, citizen and community, professional associations, NonGovernmental Organizations, and media);

 Fourth, fully implemented with effective leadership, technical competence and managerial skills, as well as effective multi/cross-sectoral and multilevel collaboration and coordination; and

 Fifth, regularly monitored with a timely and high quality health information, and effective feedback, providing supportive analytical tool to policy makers, planners and implementers to make adaptation of operational plan and interventions to unexpected changes in situation.

1.3

ROLES OF

HSP3

The HSP3 is the MoH's "strategic management tool" to guide the MoH and all health institutions as well as concerned stakeholders to effectively and efficiently use their available resources, to translate health strategies into action in pursuit of achieving the defined goals and objectives of the Plan. As such the HSP3 is characterized by the following:

 First, it renews a long-term vision for improving health and wellbeing of the Cambodian people, and re-affirms the MoH's commitment to meeting the vision (health development goals), thereby contributing to achieving socio-economic development goals of RGC;

 Second, it outlines a strategic framework for further strengthening the operation in the entire health sector (both public and private) to address agreed sector priority by refining sector strategies and sets of its strategic interventions in order to pursue strategic outcome;

4/147

 Third, it layouts an operational framework to ensure that the sector strategies are consistently applied across programs' interventions, resulting in appropriate alignment of the program interventions with the sector strategy. In so doing, the programs' outcome can be consolidated toward achieving strategic outcome and health development objectives;

 Fourth, it outlines a framework for monitoring and evaluating progress and results of the Plan implementation on an annual basis (Annual Performance Review), followed by Mid-Term Review and final evaluations; and

 Fifth, it is a potential tool for mobilizing financial resources and informing fiscal allocation, as well as guiding development assistance in the health sector to support agreed sector priorities and interventions, in order to enhance harmonization and alignment.

1.4

CONTEXT OF PLAN DEVELOPMENT

The development of the HSP3 was strategically guided by two driven-contexts. Firstly, internal context that is strengths and weaknesses of the health system performance. Most importantly, the plan is fundamentally built upon the successes of the sector policies, strategies and plans interventions over the last decades by taking health problems of the population and challenges to health system into account. Secondly, external context that is opportunities and implications of politics, legislations, national policy, strategy and plan, and the on-going national reform programs that effect choices of health strategy and its successful implementation.

 The National Constitution (Article 72)  Organic Laws  Health Legislation  Political platform and Rectangular Strategy Phase III of the RGC  Policy on Public Service Delivery  Decentralization and de-concentration policy including Social Accountability

Framework for Subnational Democratic Development.  National Strategy for Protection of the Poor and Vulnerable Peoples  National Strategic Development Plan 2014-2018  Public Administrative Reform  Public Financial Management Reform  Regional and global health development agenda (ASEAN Economic Community and Sustainable Development Goals).

APPROACH TO PLAN FORMULATION

Structure

The Figure 1.1 depicts the structures for developing the HSP3. The formulation process is under leadership of the Minister of Health, and guided (oversight) by the Technical Working Group for Health (TWGH) Secretariat, while the implementation of the process is led, managed, coordinated and facilitated by Director of Department of Planning & Health Information, with technical support of six Task Teams (TT), namely TT for (i) Health Service Delivery, (ii) Essential Support Services and Basic Infrastructure Development, (iii) Health System Financing, (iv) Health Workforce Development, (v) Health Information System, and (vi) Health System Governance. Each TT comprises of technical officers of both the MoH and Health Partners (including NGOs). DPHI Bureau of Policy, Planning & Health Sector Reform technically, administratively, logistically supports the whole process.

Process

Like the previous plan formulation, the MoH adopted participatory and consultative approach to HSP3 development. The process basically involved a number of main activities, including desk reviews, assessment of burden of diseases, sector analysis, data analysis of CDHS 2014, assessment of burden of diseases and costing exercise. Development and consultative workshops were organized in order to generate input from the MoH Task Forces for Monitoring & Evaluation of HSP, Sub-Committees of TWGHs, concerned Ministries/Agencies, Provincial Health Departments, Operational Districts and Health facilities, subnational level administrations including local councils, professional associations, academic institutions, private sector, and Health Partners including NGOs.

Outcome and Timeline

The whole process lasted for 16 months, starting from July 2014 to December 2015, resulting in the development of a comprehensive Plan (HSP3) supported by costing of priority program interventions. The HSP3 will be launched at the National Health Congress in 2016, followed by dissemination workshops for the implementation of the Plan.

COUNTRY OVERVIEW

2.1

I

NTRODUCTION

Cambodia is officially known as the Kingdom of Cambodia, and once known as the Khmer Empire.

RGC brought an end to two-decade civil conflicts plaguing the country and consolidated peace in 1998. Since then RGC Cambodia has made great strides to rehabilitate and develop the country. Political and security stability has laid out favorable environment for impressive economic growth and considerable poverty reduction as the government was able to implement its reforms and improve the socioeconomic infrastructure. These foundations enable further economic growth to achieve the government's medium term objective of maturing from least developed country to upper middle-income country by 2030.

Cambodia is located in the southern portion of the Indochina Peninsula in Southeast Asia, bordering the Gulf of Thailand, between Thailand, Vietnam, and Laos, and in tropical zone, just 10-13 degrees north of the equator. Like most of countries in Southeast Asia, Cambodia is dominated by the annual monsoon cycle with its alternating wet/rainy and dry seasons, with little seasonal temperature variation; the wet season is 27-35 °C (June-October), and the dry season is 17-27 °C (cool: November-February) & 29-38 °C (hot: March-May).

DEMOGRAPHIC AND

H

EALTH

T

RANSITION

Cambodia is currently going through a phase of demographic transition. The population pyramids, illustrated in Figure 2.1, shows the age and sex structure. The expected changes in the demographic compositions will have an impact on the social (especially education) and economic sectors thereby creating the new to generate opportunities for a young population entering the labor workforce.

The demographic dynamic is also indicative of the potential changes in the health services needs of the population. It is estimated that by 2020, the total population will be 16.5 million, of which 9.83%, 6.5%, and 27% is children aged less than 5 years, people with age over 60 years, and women with reproductive age (WRA; 15-49), respectively. Demand for health care for these groups will be much higher than that of the other population age groups. For instance, a significant increase in young adults will increase the demand for adolescent and youth reproductive health services.

Further, the Cambodian population is aging and is increasingly urban (an average annual increase of 5%). An increase in the elderly population will imply that the demand will be more for non-communicable and long-term care services.

Cambodia is also witnessing an epidemiological transition. The health system is facing the dual challenge of on-going burden of communicable diseases and a growing epidemic of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). NCDs are already the largest cause of mortality in Cambodia, increasing from 31.9% in 2000 to 51.8% in 2013.

To cope with the rising burden of NCDs, the existing structures of the health system will need to be strengthened, modified and expanded in different ways, while consolidating

OCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

Prospective of economic growth

During 2009-2012, Cambodia achieved an average economic growth of 5.6% per year and is forecasted to continue to grow. Together with the economic growth, fiscal performance has improved, providing for additional revenue, and allowing for increased public spending. Figure 2.4 indicates indicative recurrent budget expenditure for public health over the next five years. Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth (at constant price 2000) was 7.6% in 2013, and is expected to be 7% per annum during 2014-2018. There was a double-digit growth in GDP for 2004-2007. GDP per capita increased to USD 1,036 in 2013, and continues to increase to USD 1,579 in 2018. The level of Official Development Assistance (including grants and loans for both technical and capital assistance) is projected to decline over the coming years. Table 2.3 shows the performance of key economic indicators.

Success of poverty reduction, even so challenges remain ahead….

The national poverty rate has declined from 47.8% in 2007 to 19.8% 2

in 2011. (Figure 2.2) This trend has been driven by a steady reduction in the rural poverty rates from about 53% in 2007 to about 21% in 2011 and has been the result of large and sustained investments in agriculture and rural infrastructure. This has helped Cambodia achieve the MDG target of halving the proportion of people below the national poverty line well ahead of time. Despite these gains, a sizeable proportion of the population continues to live below the the national poverty line (US$1.25 per day 3

). This creates the need for ongoing efforts to bridge the poverty gap, and also prevent the vulnerable population from falling into the poverty trap.

HEALTH SYSTEM OVERVIEW

3.1

I

NTRODUCTION

The MOH is mandated by the RGC to lead and manage the entire health sector - public services as well as governance of private health sector. The health system is operating in a complex environment, given the diverse social determinants of health and interrelation between health and economic development.

The Cambodian health system comprises of both public and private sector (including both for-profit and non-for profit health organizations). The public sector is the prominent providers of preventive services and inpatient admissions, whereas the private sector tends to dominate as providers of curative services, and mainly of outpatient consultations.

The MOH has implemented health sector reform since 1994. The main objective for the reform is "to improve and extend primary health care through the implementation of a district-based health system approach"5. The reform is put into place to meet the people's essential health needs by:

 Improving the population's confidence in public health services  Clarifying and reinforcing the roles of hospitals and health centers  Establishing each facility's catchment area to ensure coverage of the population

 Rationalizing the allocation and use of financial and human resources

The health sector reform has brought in tough change "from administrative-based to population and accessibility-based health system organization." As consequences, the current Cambodian health system is organized into three levels: Central, provincial and operational district level (as depicted in Figure 3.1). Roles and functions of each level are clearly defined.

Rationale and Background

Prior to 1995, general policy of the MOH aimed to have a clinic in each commune, a hospital in each district and a provincial hospital in each province. In practice, such system did not meet the population's essential health needs for because:

 Basic infrastructures including building and equipment were in poor conditions

 There were a shortage of skilled staff and lack of motivation  Commune clinic and district hospital activities were not clearly differentiated  Population size covered by clinic and hospital was either too large or too small

 Location of facilities was often inappropriate.

The health sector reform is part of the National Public Administrative Reform, which indicates the RGC's political commitment to rehabilitating and improving public sector effectiveness and efficiency. The health sector reform entails important transformation, both organizational and financial, including:

 Rational distribution of resources based on health coverage plan: financial, infrastructure, drugs, equipment and human resources;  Reorganization of the MOH institutional structures at central, provincial and district levels;

 Budgetary reform;

 A new definition of the health system and the type of services expected at each of its levels;

 Redistribution and retraining of health staff; and  Introduction of new ways to finance health services.

Health Coverage Plan

The Health Coverage Plan (HCP) is a framework for developing the health system infrastructure, based on population and geographical criteria (Table 3.1), taking quality of care and availability of resources into account 6

. It aims to:

 Develop health services by defining criteria for the location of health facilities and their catchment areas;

 Allocate financial and human resources in equitable way with improved efficiency;

 Ensure that population health needs are met in an equitable way through coverage of the whole population.



<Table 3.1 Criteria for Establishment of Health Facilities>

Facility Population Accessibility

Health Center Optimal size: 10,000 Range: 8,000-12,000 Within 10km or 2hrs walk maximum for the catchment area population.

Referral Hospital

Optimal size: 100,000 Range: 60,000 to 200,000 In populated area; within 2 hours drive or boat journey and in rural areas; not more than 3-hour drive or boat journey

Health Post

Range: 2,000-3,000

Distance from a commune or village to the nearest HC is more than 20km, with a geographical barrier (river, mountain, or poor roads)

Application of the criteria

 In low density provinces like Mondulkiri, Ratanakiri, Prahvihear, Koh Kong and few other provinces, some factors result in inadequate health service coverage:

 Cultural and language differences exists,  Some communes and villages are scattered and isolated with small population,

 Transport to district towns and between communes is difficult. Some communes get cut off from the districts during the rainy season,  Problems in posting and retaining skilled staff.

6 MOH (December 1997). Guidelines for Developing Operational Districts

18/147

In this context, in remote commune with at least 3,000 inhabitants, HPs should be established and function as the lowest level within the district health system and thus the first point of contact in low density provinces.

 In populated areas, modification needs to be made in the criteria for the HCP for the Capital and municipalities, as well as urban town areas because of the following reasons:

 Geographical access to health services is generally not a problem  Private health providers are crowded and become a larger part of service provision in those areas

 Large hospital facilities of both public and private exist, especially in Phnom Penh.

In this context, establishment of a RH for each City/Khan/District and a HC for each Sangkat is not justifiable in terms of economy of scale or return of investment. Therefore, the catchment population can range from 15,000 to 25,000 for a HC, and over 300,000 for a RH.

3.3

ROLES AND FUNCTIONS OF EACH LEVEL

Central Level

The key laws and regulations setting out the MOH's functions and other health functions are:

 A law, Kram NS/RKM/0196/06 (1996) on Establishment of the Ministry of Health, which establishes the Ministry's public service delivery role.

 A detail on the MOH's mission and functions are described in Sub-decree, Anukret 67 (1997, 18 years ago now). Its mission is "to lead and manage the health sector of Cambodia". Its functions are presented in Box 3.1.

Anukret 67 also defines the organization chart (Figure 2.2) and terms of reference (ToRs) of the central level of the MOH and lists the national institutes and hospitals and Provincial Health Departments (PHDs) that are subordinate to the MOH (Annex 1). The organization chart and ToRs or the MoH's PHDs and ODs are set out in the MOH's administrative orders (Prakas).

The MOH responsibilities related to regulation of the private sector - the private health sector, health professionals, food and drugs, and abortion are governed by Kram, which give detailed indication of obligatory functions of the MOH for regulation of these aspects of the health sector.

As of 31 December 2015, there are 25 Municipal/Provincial Health Departments (M/PHD) and 25 Municipal /Provincial Referral Hospitals that are under direct administration of the M/PHDs. The provincial level is intermediate level or interface between the central and operational district level within the health system. The main role of the M/PHDs) is to link the MOH and ODs through:

 Interpretation, dissemination and implementing National Health Policy and Health Strategic Plan through operational strategy development and annual planning including budgeting.

 Supporting the development of ODs by regular supportive supervision and monitoring and evaluation.

 Ensuring equitable distribution and effective utilization of available financial and human resources.

 Mobilizing additional resources  Providing continuing education in close collaboration with the regional training centers.

 Performing delegated regulatory functions of private health providers and pharmaceuticals.

 Promoting coordination and collaboration with relevant stakeholders including local administrations

Operational District Level

As of 31 December 2015, there are 92 OD offices out of the total 197 administrative D/K/Cs. OD is the most peripheral sub-unit within the health system closest to the population, and composed of HCs/HPs and RHs. Its main role is to implement the operational district health objectives through:

 Interpretation, disseminating and implementing national policies   Maintain effective, efficient, and comprehensive services (promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative) according the national clinical practice guidelines/protocols

 Ensuring equitable distribution and effective utilization of available financial and human resources.

 Mobilizing additional resources for district health services  Providing in-service training   Providing support to HCs/HPs and RHs through supportive supervision and monitoring and evaluation.

Increase in the size of the health workforce has been central to improvements in the

coverage and access to health services. This has been outcome of concerted and

coordinated efforts since the 1990s. In order to prioritize the rebuilding of the health

workforce, the Ministry of Health invested in the Health Workforce Development Plan 1

(1997-2005), which focused on adequate production and equitable distribution of health

workforce according to the then newly adopted Health Coverage Plan. Building on the

achievements from the first plan, the second Health Workforce Development Plan (2006-

2015) aimed to further address the issues of improving the competency and management

of the health workforce. The specific focus granted to health workforce under these Plans

resulted in impressive gains. For instance, between 2010 and 2015, the total size of the

public sector workforce increased from 18,133 to 20,954. This has been accompanied by

a rapidly growing though loosely regulated private sector with more than 5,500 licensed

providers, which deliver a large proportion of health services (mainly curative care), and

a larger number of unregistered informal providers, the exact number of which is not

known.

22/147

Within the public sector, nurses and midwives together comprise 70% of the health workforce. Between 2010 and 2015, there was a 29% increase in the number of midwives and a more modest 6% increase in the number of nurses. The numbers of specialist and general medical practitioners, dentists and pharmacists have also increased marginally over the same period.

In the public sector, in 2015, 51% of the workforce is women, but gender distribution within categories is not equitable. The majority of female public sector health workers are concentrated in such cadres as nurses and midwives. However, only 33% of nurses are female, while 100% of midwives are women. Female are underrepresented in certain cadres as specialists, general doctors and dentists.

In 2015, the Ministry of Health central offices and national hospitals in Phnom Penh employed 18% of total public sector health workers; while the Ministry's provincial health service employed the remaining 82%. While the majority of general medical practitioners work at the provincial level (63%), most specialists work at the central level (79%). At the same time, most physician assistants (76%), dental assistants (82%), primary nurses (98%) and midwives (100%) work at the provincial level.

PRIVATE

S

ECTOR

Cambodia has a mixed health delivery system. The private-for-profit are an important provider of health services and has grown rapidly in the past years. While it is mainly concentrated in urban and economically advantaged areas, it is also becoming pervasive in rural areas. As of December 2014, there are over 8,000 formal private providers/facilities in the country; these facilities ranged from pharmacies and solo practice to specialized hospitals. The private health care is dominant for ambulatory treatment of illness, and accounts for the largest share of total health care spending. It is less dominant for inpatient treatments and limited for preventive and public health services. Available evidence also point towards the quality of services in the private health sector. Despite the existence of basic legislation, regulation of the private sector remains a challenge and mainly due to constraints in the institutional, informational, financial capacity.

Private non-for-profit sector also plays an important role in health service delivery in Cambodia. Most of the local and international organizations work at district and communities levels providing a range of services such as community-based health service network, health education and promotion activities etc.

As of December 2015, there were over 180 NGOs working in the health sector.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

4.1

I

NTRODUCTION

Based on the findings of the health sector review (Chapter 6) and certain key aspects highlighted in Chapter 1 and Chapter 2, this Chapter presents some conclusions. It focuses on two main outcomes of health system performance: health outcome of the population and financial risk protection. It describes the health system performance in terms of access and coverage, quality, efficiency, equity and governance.

With an insight understanding that the Cambodian health system has entered a period of further strengthening and consolidating the existing proven programs and interventions, rather than piloting and experimentation that was characteristic of earlier periods, the recommendations are built upon impetus gained in the health sector in the last decade, by taking the current and future challenges and foreseen opportunities into account. The recommendations concentrate on making health service delivery work better than before.

4.2

CONCLUSIONS

In the last decade, considerable improvement has been made in population health outcomes. This can be attributed to efforts to strengthen the health system, thereby resulting in improved health service delivery. This has been further facilitated by macro-level factors such as stable economic growth and rapid poverty reduction. Even so challenges remain ahead.

The efforts to strengthen the health system have been successful, which has helped achieve the health-related targets of the Cambodian Millennium Development Goal (CMDGs) several years ahead of the schedule. Recently, Cambodia was certified by World Health Organization as a measles-free country. However, addressing the other existing and emerging health issues remains a pressing issue.

 Life expectancy at birth increased from 65.6 years in 2000 to 71.4 in 2012  The maternal mortality ratio decreased from 437 deaths per 100 000 live births in 2000 to 206 in 2010, with a further decline to 170 by 2014.

26/147

 The under-five mortality rate decreased from 110.5 to 35 deaths per 1,000 live births between 2000 and 2014 between 2002 and 2014 from 1511 reported cases to 668.

 Neo-natal mortality has declined more slowly and in 2010 represented 50%

of all under 5 mortality

 HIV prevalence among the general population (adults 15-49 years) fell from

1.6% in 2000 to 0.6% in 2014 with 90% survival after 12 months of infection

(achieved through widespread ARV coverage at 67% of people living with

HIV in 2013)

 Malaria mortality fell rapidly from 135 deaths in 2010 to 10 in 2015 and the

malaria mortality rate reported by public health facilities is approaching zero

(at 0.06 per 100 000 population in 2015).

 The prevalence of tuberculosis per 100,000 populations more than halved

(1)

There has been an impressive gain in providing financial risk protection to the poor. Despite this gain, other vulnerable populations- people in high-risk, mobile and migrant populations, people with disabilities, ethnic minorities, elderly and the near-poor continue to bear financial hardship when accessing health care.

The expansion of Health Equity Fund schemes (HEFs) has proven a relatively effective investment for improving health outcomes of the poor. Even though, there is a critical need to expand social health protection mechanisms to other target populations, considering the increasing trend in individual households' out-of-pocket (OOP) spending in health. The overreliance on OOP correlates with high incidence of financial catastrophe and impoverishment; consequently, majority of the population is at risk of financial hardship when accessing health care. Thus the social health protection system, as an integral part of national social security systems, need to be established for both informal and formal sector populations, together with stronger regulation of healthcare market, among others.

 HEFs have entitled approximately 3,000,000 peoples living under the national poverty rate (19.7%) free access to public health services. HEFs have provided financial access for the poor, though utilization among HEF beneficiaries is still below expected levels.  Lower levels of OOP health spending and catastrophic expenditure among HEF beneficiaries.  The private health insurance industry is growing, but has very low coverage

 High OOP for health (60% of total health expenditure in 2012) poses as a

poverty trap for low-income households.

 There is a marked increase in capacity-to-pay coupled with a decline in

catastrophic health expenditure across all income quintiles.

27/147

(around 5% of the total population) and targeting only the rich.  People with disabilities constitute approximately 15% of the total population and remain vulnerable to financial hardship when accessing health care.

(2)

Promoting equity in population health outcomes deserves credits for the health service delivery. Further reducing the gap in the distribution of health services between provinces/districts, along with expansion of social health protection coverage can promote equity in health outcomes.

The health seeking behavior has improved with a larger proportion of individuals seeking treatment for illnesses, especially among the lowest income quintiles. In particular, the use of reproductive, maternal and child health services has increased. It is worthwhile to note that as compared to the general population, the utilization of public health services by HEF beneficiaries is much higher. However, in equities in the use of health services and health outcomes still persist across geographic areas and economic quintiles.

 The fertility rate for women in the poorest quintile is more than double that of the richest quintile. quintile than in the richest.

 Children in the poorest quintile have a four-fold greater risk of death before

their fifth birthday than those in the richest quintile.

 Stunting is more than twice as common among children in the poorest

(3)

There has been a significant gain in terms of access and utilization of health services by the population. Even so there is a gap in terms of availability and readiness of health service, and in particular healthcare quality that is an important determinant of service use.

Implementation of the HCP has succeeded in increasing access to public health services nationwide. The extensive expansion of road infrastructure has made public health facilities physically more accessible. However, overall, increase in the utilization of public health services has been slow, which could be either due to the non-availability or perceived (poor) quality of health services. There is a need for sustained and renewed focus on improving quality.

 Consumption of public health services by the general population remains low, with less than one outpatient consultation per inhabitant per year  Patients tend to use the private providers more frequently for outpatient services. According to CDHS 2014, only 15% of individuals who sought treatment for an illness went to a public facility first, whereas 78% accessed private clinics as their initial provider.

28/147

(4)

The overall quality of public health services has improved, mainly from improvements in structural quality as well as from improvements in the process of care. A focus on competency-based education and clinical performance of health and allied-professionals will further promote quality of health care.

Overall improvements in the quality of health services assisted the reductions in the maternal and childhood mortalities as well as reductions in the burden of communicable diseases. However, there are evidences that quality of health services still does not meet the need and expectation of service user. Resource constraints such as inadequate infrastructure, manpower, medicine and equipment, funds etc. have been an important impediment to the efforts to improve the quality of health services. This has resulted in a mismatch between the national clinical practice guidelines/protocols and available service quality.

 By 2011 Cambodia met the minimum global benchmark for provision of midwives of 6/1000 births per year; and by 2014, 81% of health facilities had at least one secondary midwife.  Perceived quality of public health services by service users was high at 87% as reported by Client Satisfaction Index.  Client satisfaction survey reported that service users were dissatisfied with the attentiveness of health-facility staff, availability of staff at night, cleanliness of facilities, and communication on illness diagnosis and prevention.

(5)

Substantial increases in Government health spending overtime to continually strengthening both quantity and quality of the health spending with the intent to improve efficiency, both allocative and technical, to achieve "better-value for money".

Over the last decade, the consistent economic growth has enabled RGC to significantly increase the spending on health. In addition, the amount of external funding also increased, albeit to a lesser extent. This resulted in significant improvements in public health infrastructure for service delivery. Despite increases in the public funding, OOP health spending still remains the major financing source for health services and most of the expenditure occurs in private health providers and facilities, where better-value for money remains a major concern. An on-going challenge is curtail the health care costs and make most efficient use of the available financial resources.

 Total Health Expenditure as percentage of GDP was 6.3% in 2014, down from 7.2% in 2012  Government health expenditure as percentage of GDP increased from 1.2%

29/147

in 2009 to 1.5% in 2013.  More than US$ 1.03 billion, or 6.3% of GDP, was spent on health care in 2014, comprising US$69 per capita of which 60% was out-of-pocket.

(6)

Progress has been made in health system governance in terms of regulation. Even so, enforcement of policy, legislation and regulation implementation remains weak. Additional legislations and regulations need to be developed.

Impressive strides have been made in the development of health policies, legislations and regulations. An example of which is the recent step undertaken to adopt a registration and licensing system for health practitioners. Efforts to improve the quality of training in health educational institutions have moved one step further with the implementation of the national entry and exit examination.

While the legal structure for governance of the health system has been developed and is in place, enforcement of remains weak due to inadequate resources, together with limited regulatory capacity.

 Pharmaceuticals law (1996); amended in 2007, Abortion law (1997), Law on management of private medical and paramedical services and medical aid (2000), HIV/AIDS Law (2002), Law on Tobacco products Control (2015), plus regulatory instruments i.e. Anoukret, Prakas, and Circulars etc.

 Regulatory mechanisms are put in places at national and subnational level for laws/regulations enforcement.

(7)

Governance and D&D

The ongoing trend towards decentralization and deconcentration (D&D) has necessitated changes in the roles and functions of the central MoH departments, municipal and provincial departments and district health offices. It has also drawn attention to the implication of the D&D process on different administration levels in terms of investments, policies and practices with the objective to improve effectiveness and efficiency of health service delivery..

 Some regulatory functions (obligatory functions) of the MoH, have been delegated to the subnational levels i.e. both provincial and district administrations. It includes issuance of licenses, regulations and laws enforcement.

30/147

4.3

KEY RECOMMENDATIONS

The following recommendations are based on the premise that the MOH is well placed to improve the quality of service delivery by further strengthening the supply-side mechanisms; and it is also well placed to improve equity in the distribution of health services by further strengthening demand-side financing, most importantly HEFs.

 Achieve more equitable distribution in health outcome across the population and in health services that are in line with national quality standards and guidelines.

 Invest in stronger and more effective systems for pre- and in-service training for health professionals to enhance their clinical and managerial competencies for further improving the quality of service delivery.

 Enforce a stronger regulatory framework along with sound financial management, administrative and pay reform to enhance continuous quality improvement efforts.

 Build on the HEFs to provide access to services for other vulnerable population groups (e.g. people with disabilities, older people, people with chronic non-communicable diseases, and children under 5).

 Ensure uniform development of social health protection schemes in terms of provider payment, benefit package, claims processing, information systems, service purchasing systems.

 Consolidate the demand-side financing schemes in a national social health protection structure and system to advance the move towards universal health coverage, and to support increased demand for public health services, and to leverage healthcare quality.

 Explore opportunities for the use of performance-based financing in the purchasing function of social health protection institutions to improve performance and increase quality and efficiencies.

 Further strengthen the health promotion, primary and secondary prevention activities for NCDs in the health sector and with the community to stem the longer-term growth and reduce health care costs.

 Increase domestic financial resources for national programs to close financial gaps as result of the reduction in funding from the global partners and other development partners, and integrate these programs within the broader process of health service delivery system.

31/147

 Given evolving D&D process, redefine the roles and functions of the MoH and its institutions at all levels, and then adjust their organizational structures, accordingly, and consider moving from macro-level planning to micro-level to provide for the necessary staff placements; monitor results not only as outputs but as outcomes (results, quality).

 Invest in technology transfer and its use for health services delivery - to enhance knowledge and diagnostic capacity among health providers and connect them to their patients; for enhanced information products for decision making; and for the monitoring and evaluation of health system performance.

SECTOR PRIORITIES

5.1

I

NTRODUCTION

At a broader level, priority-setting is determined by the global commitment to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), taking into account the socio-economic conditions and impact of on-going Government reforms. The demographic and health transition also adds an additional layer of complexity to the health system.

Strategically, the priority setting is driven by rational approach to allocating available resources to ensure access, quality, efficiency and equity i.e. focusing on prioritizing health problems and interventions.

5.2

CHALLENGES

Challenges to epidemiology (diseases and health problems)

 Maternal, infant and under-5 mortality remain relatively high compared to other countries in the region.In addition, inequities in the health outcomes across socio-economic groups persist.

 Malnutrition (acute and chronic) among women and children remain stubbornly high; severely impacting their health and cognitive abilities later in life.

 An increased incidence of teenage pregnancy (aging 15-19) is likely to increase demand of adolescent reproductive health services. This challenge, together with relatively low institutional deliveries by women from lower economic groups, can slow down the reduction of maternal and neonatal mortality.

 HIV transmission remains significant amongst the marginalized populations including female entertainment workers, men having sex with men, transgender persons and people who inject drugs.

 Despite achievements, mortality rate and prevalence of tuberculosis (TB) still remains high.

 Artemisinin resistant malaria remains a public health concern of global significance.

 Increases in the prevalence of NCDs, together with the aging population and increasing urbanization pose as a challenge to the structure and delivery model of the existing health system.

 Burden of mental health disorders remains an unaddressed concern; especially since the health system is ill equipped to deal with the service needs.

 Growing threat of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases exposes the vulnerability of the health system and also acts as a global health security threat.

 Potential risk to human health resulting from environmental health risks and climate changes remains an unaddressed but pressing concern.

Challenges to the health system performance

 Growing demand for better quality health services, as the current quality of health services provided in both public and private sector is generally considered inadequate.

 Effective delivery of quality health service is constrained by inadequate resources, mainly under-staffing, limited diagnostic capacity, and insufficient supply of medicines and health commodities.

 Inadequate capacity of public health services to deal with diseases/health problems related to CDs and as NCDs, and public health emergency including pandemic of emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases, disaster preparedness and response.

 Gaps in physical infrastructure limit the expansion/strengthening of existing health services or the establishment of new services.

 Low level of risk pooling; also strategic purchasing mechanisms are not yet in place. Apart from HEFs, there is no social health insurance system for either the formal and informal population.

 Equitable distribution of health workers is a challenge with implication on the efficient delivery of health services at various levels and in facilities within the health system.

34/147

 Competency and skills of health workers remain limited. Moreover, in the absence of complimentary skill mix with health care team the quality of health services remains compromised.

 Lack of investment in ICT, including a central repository of existing health databases, has resulted in the absence of a single, comprehensive information system for monitoring and evaluation in the health sector.

 Multiple M&E frameworks, indicators and reporting systems; project/program-related M&E (tools/teams); and donor-driven research and evaluation agenda based on their own interests and pilot initiatives.

 Limited capacity at central, subnational and health facility level to use, analyze and interpret data. Limited use of the HMIS by clinical and administrative staff to make managerial decisions.

 Rapid growth of the private health sector poses a challenge to the stewardship function of the MoH and its ability to regulate across all levels of the health system.

(1)

On demand-side

 Rising demand for health care services has not been matched by increases in the utilization of public health services.

 A considerable proportion of the population suffers a variety of disabilities, including vision and hearing impairments, negatively impacting their socioeconomic participation. There is an unmet demand for disability-specific services, including provision of supportive devices and social assistance.

 Inappropriate health-seeking behavior of the population, especially in rural/remote areas (e.g. delay seeking care, self-medication, seeking care from unqualified providers etc.,) and preference of using antibiotics and injections.

O

PPORTUNITIES

The on-going, impressive economic growth along with progressive reform processes provided the MoH with an opportunity to make important improvements in the health sector, in particular health service delivery..

 The RGC's strong political commitment led to attainment of the MDGs. This is likely to be re-affirmed for the SDGs (particularly in advancing towards universal health coverage).

 The NSDP 2014-2018 provides the foundation for investing in health as a means to develop human capital, building a more productive workforce.

35/147

 Cambodia continues to experience a sustained and strong economic growth that increases fiscal space and capacity, allowing the Government to increase public spending in health.

 PFM reform have resulted in consistent increases in the budgetary investment in health and has led to improved credible budget and financial flow, transparent budget allocation and expenditure, robust auditing system and increased performance by public service providers through result based budgeting.

 Salary reforms that are consistent and conform to broader civil service policies can help improve the productivity and motivation of the health staff.

 D&D process hold great potential if properly structured and steered. It can potentially improve administrative and fiscal efficiencies, besides making the system more accountable and responsive to local community needs.

 "ASEAN Economic Community" - The ASEAN Member States (AMSs) have committed to the realization of an economic community by 2015, which includes the establishment of a single market and production base. This provides immense potential from trade and commerce arising from regional integration but also poses as a challenge and economic risks i.e. remain competitive in a unified market. While progress has already been made in liberalizing trade in goods between ASEAN member states, liberalization in the areas of trade in services and investment as well as the mobility of skilled labor has seen relatively slow. The Mutual Recognition Arrangements (MRA) has not been implemented completely. The implementation of the MRA and facilitation of the mobility of health workers (namely doctors, dentists, nurses) will involve further work in the adaptation of national laws and regulations. Furthermore, there is still limited understanding and awareness of the potential implication of these processes on the health labor market, both public and private sector.

Along with the above-mentioned opportunities, the following proven interventions in the health sector have created favorable environment for further strengthening the supply of quality health services in a responsive and publicly accountable manner.

 Growing support within the Government to build on HEFs as a mechanism to cover the population in the informal sector, especially rural and vulnerable groups.

 The Government funded Midwifery Incentives Scheme and the Government-DPs funded Service Delivery Grant, if institutionalized through expansion of SOAs.

36/147

 With significant achievements at national level (budget, personnel) the opportunity has arisen to strengthen service delivery at sub-national level (through expansion of SOAs or other supply-side interventions).

 Stronger demand for healthcare due to improved health literacy and establishment of social health protection mechanisms, such as HEFs.

ECTOR PRIORITY

Ideally, priority-setting is driven by an important understanding of the main reasons behind the limited response in demand for public health services and ways whereby the supply side can ensure access and coverage, and quality of health service provision that meets the need and expectations of service users, and gain their trust on the public health system. Specifically, it is based on (i) the magnitude of the burden of diseases and other health problems-defining/re-defining priority health service packages and interventions, (ii) target population-hard-to-reach and vulnerable populations, (iii) resource availability (finance and human)-directing/re-directing resource investment.

Health Priorities

 Further reduce maternal, childhood and neo-natal mortality, especially across geographical area and socio-economic groups, and reduce prevalence of malnutrition among women and children.

 Further reduce the burden of communicable diseases, mainly HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, Malaria and Dengue, and others (Leprosy, Helminthiasis, emerging and re-merging diseases)

 Growing burden of NCDs necessitates its effectively management through the reorientation of the health system and more intensive engagement with the communities.

Health System Priorities

Investment in the health system to address the priority health problems of the population falls within three correlated broad areas: resource infrastructure, social health protection and institutional development and governance.

 Improve equitable distribution of health facilities across geographical location (rural vs. urban) with greater attention to a trade-off, to the maximum possible extent, between efficient and effective health service delivery and effective investment in basic infrastructure - promoted equitable access and economy of scale.

37/147

 Bridge the gap in health service delivery in terms of service availability and readiness, with emphasis on adequate supply of appropriate equipment, medicines, commodities and health personnel at health facilities - readily available health services to be used.

 Ensure health services provided are acceptable with adequate quality at affordable cost throughout the country in order to meet the need and expectation of the population - gained population trust on the public health services, hence increased utilization.

 Ensure equitable distribution of health workers with the required competencies and skills to provide patient-centered services that are responsive to population needs.

 Improve the governance and management of the health workforce to create a team of well-supported, adequately compensated and motivated health staff that are equipped to provide quality health services.

 Prepare a health workforce that is geared to address challenges resulting from the evolving demographic and epidemiological changes.

 Ensure the production of a competent health workforce by creating and enhancing mechanisms to buttress the quality of training in health educational institutions such as the establishment of an accreditation system.

 Reinforce regulatory mechanisms including registration and licensing of health practitioners, to create overarching safeguards to protect patient safety.

 Develop health legislation and regulations necessary to implement and enforce existing laws concerning the licensing and accreditation of both public and private health care facilities and ensure provision of adequate resources for enforcement.

 Expand target population (HEFs beneficiaries) and benefit packages of HEFs and ensure optimal access to and utilization of health services for them.

 Initiate pathway to establish social health insurance system in informal sector population within the RGC policies and strategic framework for developing the national social security system, when applicable.

 Enhance ICT and technology transfer-application of technology and practice for health care service delivery and health products, and health service management, disease surveillance and response, M&E system, along with capacity building for data processing, analysis, interpretation, dissemination and use.

38/147

 Use and expand appropriate technology, skills to use and interpret the collected data, comprehensiveness of the information and confidentiality. Develop and enforce legislation concerning data security and privacy.

 Efficiency in the use of financial resources by improving transparency and accountability, further realignment of resource allocation between central and peripheral health services, improving efficiency in medicines procurement and supply management, a reallocation of budget funds towards health care delivery and allocation of budgets based on population needs.

 Provide incentives for quality health care through various measures, including improvements in physical and human resources infrastructure, incentive programs, performance contracting, and strategic purchasing by social health protection institutions.

 Financial risk protection, to reduce the levels of OOP spending, catastrophic expenditure, impoverishment and health-related indebtedness.

 Equity in access to services, to target public resources on the provision of primary health care services in rural and remote areas and expansion of effective social health protection schemes.

 Equity in utilization, to address the geographical and socioeconomic differentials in service delivery and utilization.

 Strengthen the regulatory system for medicines and medical products as an essential component of the health system for achieving access to and rational use of quality, safe, efficacious and affordable medicines considering the growing emergence of antimicrobial resistance and economic and health consequences of poor quality medicines.

 Raise awareness and understanding on health issues amongst the general population.

SECTOR PERFORMANCE REVIEW

6.1

INTRODUCTION

A review of the health sector performance in the period 2008-2015 generated observations on the achievements and progress, and also identified challenges faced by the health sector. The review also explored the opportunities of the future prospect of the development of the health sector in the coming five years. It focused on the main issues of the five cross-cutting strategic areas of the HSP2 through an analysis of the available data/information related to key indicators of the health system performance, ranging from input, process/system to output and outcome indicators. The analysis shed the light on what did the health system actually work well and what did not so, and what need to be further improved, and in particular how to work better in the future.

BURDEN

OF

DISEASE

Finding 1 Burden of Diseases

The standard indicator for burden of disease is the Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY). The DALYs for a specific disease are measured as the total of the Years of Life Lost (YLL) due to premature mortality within the study population from that disease, and the Years Lived with Disability (YLD) for people in the study population who are living with the disease.

The major findings of the assessment are:

40/147

 Key priorities for child health would be to reduce the burden of mortality from neonatal conditions, as well improve the nutritional status of children, from both macro- and micronutrient deficiencies, while addressing the morbidity and mortality from acute respiratory infections and diarrhoeal diseases.  Tuberculosis ranks among the top three causes of both mortality and morbidity, and highlights the important challenges associated with case detection and successful treatment.  Other infectious diseases of importance are Hepatitis B and dengue.  Non-communicable diseases - mainly ischaemic heart disease, stroke and chronic obstructive lung disease are the emerging priorities. This is supplemented by an evolving threat from rising prevalence of principal NCD risk factors - hypertension, diabetes and overweight; as well as behavioural factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption.  Mental health conditions comprise a major component of morbidity and the common conditions include post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety disorders.  Road traffic accidents are the 4th leading cause of DALYs among males, and 13 th among females, with the majority of both mortality and morbidity occurring at ages 20-49 years.

EALTH SERVICE DELIVERY

Finding 2 Capacity of Health Service Delivery

In the past decade, there have been considerable investments in health infrastructure. . Such investment includes, but is not limited to, construction, rehabilitation, renovation and expansion of HC/HP/RH, supply of medical equipment, medicines and health

42/147

commodities, ICT network, means of transportation, production of health professionals, competency and skill development, and other essential supporting services - such as laboratory and blood bank services. This investment has been made with the intention of improving both access and utilization of health services..

 138 HCs were newly established, especially in remote areas, reaching the total number of 1,105 HC by 2015. If generally applied an optimal population size of 10,000 populations per HC, regardless urban vs. rural location, the catchment population currently covered by a HC is 12,500. Thus equitable distribution of HC across the population is fairly met. In this regard, the future investing in constructing new HC need to be carefully considered as long as effective and efficient services and economy of scale is concerned.  The ratio of public hospital bed (excluding TB beds) to the total population is slightly increased to 1 bed per 1,446 population, but does not meet the ratio recommended by HCP i.e. 1 bed per 1,000 population.  High investments in advanced medical equipment and technology in the national hospitals and national centers for medical laboratory is evident, along with the expansion of basic infrastructure at the University of Health Sciences and Regional Training Centers.  Size of public health workforce has increased around 250 persons in annual average over the last eight years. The acute shortage of midwives in 2005 has been overcome; in 2009 all health centres had at least one primary midwife and over half had a secondary midwife. In 2014, 81% of the health centres had at least one secondary midwife.  The Government health spending nearly doubled from US$104.1m in 2008 to US$199m in 2014. Health spending at provincial level has also gradually increased, despite reduction of the overall health spending in the period 2012-14. This decline was correspondent to the lower cost of medicine procurement despite maintaining the same quantity of purchased medicine. It is assumed that this was due to efficiency gains in procurement.  More medicines and health commodities have been made available at most health facilities. As a result, essential drug stock-out at HCs decreased from 13.3% in 2008 to 1.6%% in 2015.  Blood bank services are available in 21 provincial RHs and blood depots in 12 district RHs. Blood donation rate rose from 3 per 1000 population in 2008 to 4.5 per 1000 in 2014.  Each referral hospital has at least 2 ambulances, and some HCs also have an ambulance.

43/147

Finding 3 Innovative Management of Health Service Delivery

Two models of health service delivery have been put in the implementation as per the Government Policy on Public Service Delivery (2005): i) Public Administrative Enterprises (PAEs) and ii) Special Operating Agencies (SOAs). Both are flexible managerial instruments to enhance performance and accountability in the provision of public services, with main emphasis on the improvement in quality and delivery of targeted public services. The former targets the central level institutions, including 4 national hospitals, 2 health educational institutions, and a national center. The latter concentrates on provincial level, including 10 provincial referral hospitals and 36 ODs.

 As a result of the relatively high-level autonomy awarded to health institutions with PAE status, they seemingly perform better with expanded basic infrastructure and motivated staff with supplementary salary income generated from Government subsidies and revenue from user fees. . However, there still remains the need to strengthen accountability over budget revenue. .  Given institutionalized performance based practices accompanied by bonuses based on performance through "Service Delivery Grants" (SDGs) currently financed by the Government and DPs, well-managed SOAs have implemented job descriptions, performance requirements and stronger discipline for all staff; some SOAs are using these mechanisms as a basis for payment of not only the SDGs incentives, but also salary top-ups from user fees and HEF revenues.  SOA-ODs receiving SDGs appear to have generally maintained the performance improvements achieved, and have made further improvement on some performance indicators. SOAs financial management has been generally successful, even though some design and implementation issues of the funding formula and performance-related component of the SDG are still being addressed.

Finding 4 Overall health access and choice for health service providers

During 2007-2014, medical care seeking at both public and private facilities/providers (consultation or treatment sought for the illness/injury) significantly increased for all population groups, including people <60 years and older, people with disability, and peoples with chronic diseases, across all socioeconomic strata. However, consumption of public health services remains low. The low utilization of public health facilities by poor and vulnerable populations (in some cases despite HEF coverage) is a concern.

 Significantly increased care seeking at both public and private providers for all groups of the population, rising from 84% in 2007 to 98% and 2013, respectively; people with disability from 63% to 95%; and peoples with

44/147

chronic diseases from 67% to 80%.  Slow increase in utilization of public health services- per capita consultation per year increased from 0.45 in 2008 to 0.60 in 2014 while Bed Occupancy Rates increased around 15% annually.  Care seeking at formal providers increased from 50% in 2004 to 82.4% in 2013, while home care decreased from 16% to 0.2% over the same period.  People in rural areas significantly used private sector (drug store 38%, private clinics 35% and private hospitals 3%). They also used HCs, but less public hospitals. People in the capital used significantly more private hospitals and private clinics.  Children and elderly sought more care than other groups of the population. Children under 5 were significantly less likely to receive care at home compared to other age groups.

Finding 5 Quality of Health Services

The pursuit of quality improvement has been moving at a slow but steady pace in Cambodia. This has been guided by the National Policy for Quality in Health, which outlines the roadmap towards the establishment of minimum standards and benchmarks in the public health system. In line with the policy vision, a multidisciplinary approach to building up the quality of health services has been undertaken in order that all Cambodians are able to achieve the highest level of health and well-being. In addition, with the proposed plans to develop and expand the social health protection programme, instituting systems to monitor the quality of services has become more crucial. For instance, social health protection scheme operators will have to actively participate in determining the minimum acceptable quality of health care to purchase for their clients, while policy makers seek the appropriate balance of incentives to the community and providers to harness pressure on the system to improve. The private sector will also have to be actively involved, as they are also subject to a common minimum quality of care, by participating in the development of guidelines to which they are ultimately accountable. Besides, to monitor the implementation of the Code of Conduct and professional ethics, coordination bodies such as professional councils will have to enact a critical role in ensuring patient safety in both public and private sectors.

 Systems and guidelines have been established for improving performance at public hospitals, but funding for implementation and monitoring are very limited.  Hospital mortality rate decreased from 1.37% in 2010 to 0.97% in 2014.  Results of the 2012 Client satisfaction Survey suggest that the National Satisfaction Index was 86, implying that the majority of clients were satisfied with the services received at the public health facility. However clients expressed dissatisfaction in several areas, including: inattentiveness of health

45/147

facility staff, unavailability of staff at night, unclean facilities, and poor communication on illness diagnosis and prevention.  Quality assessment-Level 1 - Assessments of 50 out of 80 hospitals nationally, showing performance scores above 90% for equipment operation and maintenance, management and technical capacity.  Quality assessment --- Level 2 - assessment of the process of care in health centers and hospitals showed that the median quality score is still low, with the aggregate scores for health centers being lower than for hospitals. Further, it also demonstrated the wide variations in the quality score depending on the type of health facility, its geographical location and type of services assessed.  Prevalence of counterfeit and substandard medicines declined from 13% (in 2002) to 3% (in 2009) and 0.18% (2011) according to the second Pharmaceutical Sector Strategic Plan (2013-2018).

Finding 6 Reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health

In the last ten years, improvements in service delivery have focused on ante-, intra- & post-natal care; neonatal care; protection of mother-to-child transmission of HIV; immunization;, nutrition; management of Acute Respiratory Infections (ARIs), diarrhea, Vitamin A and folic acid supplementation, unmet need for contraception, teenage pregnancy, safe abortion, and family planning. Among the most significant improvements in service delivery, at referral hospitals and health centres, has been the increase in assisted and facility-based deliveries, uptake of antenatal and other maternal and child-health services. This progress has been possible due to the strong political commitment. In addition, the Midwifery Incentive Scheme, expansion of HEFs, and maternal health vouchers have all contributed to improvements in equitable access to these services.

 The contraceptive prevalence rate among married women has increased considerably (18% in 2000 to 39% in 2014), but unmet need for contraception remains high (13%).  The dramatic increase in the use of skilled birth attendant -89% of all deliveries by 2014, 83% institutional deliveries- a result of long-term efforts beginning in 2000, when only 10% of births were institutional.  Breastfeeding is nearly universal - 93% of children aged 0-5 months are breastfed. While exclusively breastfeeding is common, it is still not universal.  C-section rate (as percentage of total deliveries) increased annually around 1% largely due to the increased number of facilities providing Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (EmONC), along with increased detection of pregnant women-at risk.

46/147

 Reductions in under-5 mortality is associated with improved coverage of effective interventions including routine immunization, and new vaccines, malaria prevention and treatment, vitamin A supplementation, and early and exclusive breastfeeding, and implementation of IMCI.  "Zero-case" of measles was notified in November 2011. Cambodia was certified as 'measles free' by WHO in May 2015 - the only low-income country to have achieved this status in Asia and Pacific region.

Finding 7 Communicable diseases

In the past 5-10 years, Cambodia has made major advances in the control of communicable diseases - a testament of the strong disease control programs. As a result, the country was able to achieve many health related MDGs-6 targets several years in advance.

The three-disease programs, -HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria were generally well funded by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and in some cases from other sources. However, the program review has drawn attention to the medium to long-term risks of relying on a single source of external funding. Attention has also been drawn to the need to strengthen the response to other communicable diseases in terms of improved notification, reporting and emergency responses.

More attention will be needed to build health system capacity in the area of pandemic response for emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, such as avian influenza. While national structures for pandemic preparedness (as well as national pandemic influenza preparedness plans and Avian and Human Influenza) are in place, further development of surveillance and rapid containment of poultry related transmission is required. In particular, stronger linkages with other sectors are required as pandemic preparedness programs sit mostly with non-MOH agencies. An increasing level of investment in pandemic preparation has contributed to improvement in health system surveillance, laboratory capacity, monitoring and evaluation and public communications. While there is a commitment to meet the International Health Regulations requirements for disaster preparedness capacity by 2016, the health system has limited capacity despite recent improvements and the stockpiles of protective equipment, vaccines and supplies are insufficient.

 The quality of TB care has improved, evidenced by a lower MDR at 1.4% for new cases, and 10% for retreatment; the treatment outcome success rate has been >90% for ten years. DOTs have been implemented at all health facilities, together with Community-based DOTs.  In the past decade, the adult HIV prevalence has declined by nearly 60%. The country has achieved the universal access target for treatment, with approximately 80% of adults and children estimated to be in need receiving antiretroviral treatment. The recently launched third strategic plan,

47/147

"Cambodia 3.0," builds on these successes and outlines an approach for eliminating new HIV infections and AIDS deaths by 2020. Malaria incidence is at its lowest point ever; dengue fever incidence is declining.  Progress has been significant also for neglected tropical diseases (NTD), including schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis which are targeted for elimination. Cambodia was the first country to pass the 75% international target for coverage of drug distribution for the vitamin A and worms, achieving 90% among pre-school and school-aged children and women in the childbearing age group.

Finding 8 Non-communicable Diseases and Public Health Problems

The unfolding demographic and health transition in Cambodia has been evident in a sharp rise in the incidence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), particularly diabetes and hypertension, as well as cancers. Premature mortality from NCDs is rising and the prevalence of risk factors is alarming. NCDs currently account for half of the disease burden. The principal risk factors for NCDs are preventable: unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use, and harmful alcohol consumption. The Government has shown its commitment to addressing the rising NCD burden in its Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs (2014-2020).But NCD service delivery remains low in terms of availability and coverage.

 Cardio-vascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory disease and diabetes caused 52% of deaths in Cambodia in 2011, and the rate is rising.  Health centres provide NCD routine services to a limited extent.  There is currently no national screening programs for cervical or breast cancers and no cancer prevention programs. Health care services for cancer are limited.  Although mental disorders are high in Cambodian society, the health system is still ill equipped to deal with the demand and community programs to manage the condition are limited.  Cataract surgery increased from 16,150 cases to 27,354 and eye operation increased from 24,463 cases to 42,983 cases (Figure 5.16). Ophthalmological services are available in 21 RHs or 23% of the total RHs, while basic eye care services are available only at 331 HCs or 30% of the total 1,105 HCs.  With 43% of adult males smoking cigarettes, there is an urgent need for effective preventive measures to be implemented.  Accidents and injuries (almost 2% of the population being injured in 2010; two-thirds of accidental deaths are caused by road accidents)  Over-nutrition (the proportions of people 25-64 overweight and obese were 15.4% and 1.9% in 2010; 76% of respondents were physically active for an

average of six hours per day)  Alcohol consumption (a major concern in both urban and rural areas, affecting almost two-thirds of people in 2010)  Tobacco abuse (4-in-10 men and 4-in-100 women (18 years and older) smoke according to a 2010 survey, with little change from 2005;

YSTEM FINANCING

Finding 9 Sources and level of fund, and risk pooling and financial management

Together with consistent economic growth the RGC increased substantially health spending. This positive trend together with increased households' capacity to pay is also reflected in the increase of total health expenditure in the country and in the private health provision sector. Despite increased public health spending, OOP health spending remains a major funding source for the health system.

Domestic and DPs funding provide the largest single pool of funds for the health system. In risk mitigation, the largest funding pool is the unified HEFs, which cover a population of about three million poor people and was expanded nationwide. Social health insurance coverage is limited to work injury benefits provided through the National Social Security Funds; the National Social Security Funds for Civil Servants is yet to provide health benefits. Voluntary health insurance coverage is available through a small number of schemes, principally serving rural communities, and some private insurance targeting the rich and urban workers.

There has been overdependence on various external financing sources (for instance CDs prevention and control program activities), posing a major challenge to financial sustainability of the program interventions. This has also underlined the need for harmonization and alignment.

 Total health expenditure (THE) has increased substantially and reached US$1,033 million in 2012, or more than 7% of GDP. OOP health spending was 60% of this total spending, with Government and DPs funding taking an equal share (20% each).  The government's contribution amounted to US$199.1 million 2012, equalling 6.5% of total government expenditures (or 12% of total government recurrent expenditure).  On average the amount of out-of-pocket health expenditure per capita and per year was found to be between US$13.9 and US$69 in 2007 and 2014 respectively. There were significant variations in the level of spending between age groups and by economic status.  Households capacity-to-pay per year (nominal riel) increased from KHR21,345 in 2007 to KHR77,708 in 2013

49/147

 The incidence of impoverishment from health spending (households becoming poor as a result of health expenditure) reduced slightly between 2007 and 2013 from 2.5% to 1.7%.

 Household catastrophic expenditure due to health spending (% of all households) at 4.9% in 2014 remained similar to the 5.2% observed in 2009, and the incidence of household indebtedness due to health care expenditure also decreased from 2.9% to 0.9% in 2007 and 2014, respectively.

 The utilization rates (cases/person/year) of in-patient and out-patient at RHs by HEF Beneficiaries increased between 2007 and 2014 - 7.01 percent point increased of out-patient, and 5.19 percent points of in-patient. Deliveries (as % of expected deliveries) by HEF Beneficiaries at RHs and HCs increased 10.6% to 27.1% steadily, 3.1% to 23.4% from 2007 to 2014.

 Due to the rapid pace of expansion, HEFs reached 1,105 HCs (100%) and 95 RHs (97%), as targeted by 2015.

Finding 10 Human resource planning

Achievements are evident in a number of areas including policy formulation, legislation for health professional education, increased staff remuneration, improved HR reporting, staff planning and projections, staff deployment and performance and staff incentives. However, human resource planning is more challenging within a context that is rapidly changing; adaptation to change is therefore at the center of the planning tasks in areas including the epidemiological transition, new medical technologies and the growing demand for high quality and new health services. The best use of human resources can be achieved through developing the governance of a mixed health system and the MOH

50/147

has moved already to strengthen its human resource governance, planning and reporting functions.

 To fully implement the HCP there is a need to expand the total public health workforce to 36,000 by 2020, an increase 70% from 2014 level.  The Health Workforce Development Plan provides guidance on staff levels and distribution, pre-service and in-service training, management and incentives and performance management.  Legislation is being developed to further regulate the quality of medical education (public and private).

Finding 11 Human resources production

The MOH has achieved a staff of approximately 20,000 health workers nationally and has placed at least one midwife in every health centre. Even so, a further expansion of the total health-staff number will be needed to meet the growing health needs, with a more appropriate mix of staff with the necessary skills to meet existing and new health demands.

 Degree programs have been established for nurses and midwives.  Under the proposed new Law on Regulation of Health Practitioners, a mandatory system of registration and licensing of all health professionals will be established.  Despite a large number of graduating health professionals, the number recruited to civil service positions is still insufficient to meet the expanding needs. Further, the number of medical specialists is mostly sufficient to meet current needs according to CPA1, CPA2 and CPA3 hospital operations.  There is an urgent need to institute a system for accreditation of health educational institutions, especially in the wake of the recent surge in the number of private training institutions in health. The MOH Human Resources Development Department manages the continuing education process; however there is an urgent need to regularly update the database to inform training needs of health staff.

Finding 12 Human resource management

Recent achievements in human resource management include annual salary increases, potentially resulting in better staff performance. Although staff allocation has improved, as a result of better management tools, better planning and better oversight with appropriate indicators, rural vacancies continue to pose as a serious challenge. Under the SOA arrangement, new organizational and management structures with performance measurement and incentives have assisted the improved performance. The introduction of

51/147

PAE status (for University of Health Sciences, National Hospitals) has increased management flexibility.

 Better management of human resources has been achieved but low levels of recruitment into civil service position results in staffing gaps.  Despite increments in staff salary, low level of staff remuneration continues to impact staff motivation and productivity.  Rural deployment and retention needs to be addressed by the introduction of a comprehensive package of financial and non-financial incentives.A consolidated HRH database has been established to assist in improved decision making.

Finding 13 Health Management Information System

Health facility data are a critical input into assessing national progress and performance on an annual basis and they provide the basis for subnational/district performance assessment. Despite limited investment in ICT, the use of information and communications technology has grown with all hospitals and ODs reporting monthly results to the web-based Health Information System (HIS) against a range of routine indicators. Nearly 40% of health centres are able to capture and submit date electronically as well. The system captures disease and surveillance records, provided preventative MCH services, national programs data, death and births records, population data from all public health facilities and 14% of all private health services providers.

The HIS is distinguished by being the only current source of up-to-date data in real time. Routine data quality assessments in 2011, 2012 and 2013 by using WHO data quality score cards indicate that there is a generally high consistency rate between source documents and monthly HMIS reported values. However, there is still scope for improvement.

 Selected data will be made available on MOH-DPHI website in due time to the public.  At subnational level, HMIS information is used for quarterly and annual reviews, SOA performance reviews, Provincial Technical Working Group meetings, District and Provincial Health Financing Steering Committee meetings, and for annual planning and budgeting by facilities.  The MOH has seen a development of databases systems like in-service training database, personnel management database, drug information database, social health protection database, HCP database, AOP database. It is the intention to further integrate these data bases.  The data is available to a range of international institutes, universities and

52/147

researchers as well as investigators from development partners seeking information on health system performance.  PMRS is the system of electronic patient records and data management used by public health facilities for patient data management. Using unique patient ID, the system can store detailed information on the patient (name, address, contact information, photos. etc.), including data on service fee for HEF repayments.

YSTEM GOVERNANCE

Finding 14 Institutional Development

The MoH is mandated by the RGC to lead and manage the entire health sector. It is the sole authority responsible for the organization and delivery of public health services. In Cambodia, most health service delivery functions of the public sector are described in policy documents, strategies and guidelines rather than formal legal documents. These documents do not generally define the distinction between obligatory and permissive service delivery functions, though they often set priorities and targets. The MoH exerts its leadership in health system planning and development via coherent and comprehensive policy and planning frameworks. A fundamental strength of the planning process is that it is fully owned, led and managed by the MoH, with strong support from Development Partners (DPs).

 A conceptual map of the major groups of functions of the MOH at each level of its administrative hierarchy was done in 2013, and is used for functional reviews to identify functions and sub-functions of obligatory and permissive functions to be transferred to sub-national administration from now on according the second national 3-year Implementation Plan for D&D.  Functional mapping and functional review provide the MOH with analytical framework to redefine functions for each level of the health system, with explicitly spelled-out vision and clearly defined mission, accountability mechanisms and responsibility, including lines of command and communication, and to change institutional structures, accordingly in the D&D context.

Finding 15 Enforcement of health policies, legislations and regulations

Remarkable progress has been made in areas of health policy and regulations

development, along with enforcement. There is considerable scope for reinforcing the

regulatory mandate of the MOH retains the governance function for the whole health

system. An increasing challenge for health sector governance is to incorporate the public

53/147

and private health sectors along with non-government agencies and development

partners.

 Joint Prakas of the Ministry of interior and Ministry of Health on "Quality Control, Service and Measure for the Elimination of Illegal Health Product and Illegal Private Health Service for Health and Social Safety" was issued. The main objective of the Prakas is to control and take firm action on individuals who act as physician treating people, individuals who sell medicine to people at the base without recognition from Ministry of Health.

Finding 16 Coordination and collaboration

The MOH maintains the governance responsibility for the whole health sector. Significant progress made already in reducing the disease burden and in strengthening public health sector performance provides the opportunity in the coming period to extend the activities of the MOH in the coordination of health sector priorities.

 For public health care, sector-wide collaboration has been significantly improved under the Sector-Wide Management approach adopted by the MOH for the coordination and management of a proportion of the funding that supports government service delivery coming from development partners.  Close collaboration with the Ministry of Planning is a key part of the HEF process, which benefits from the national identification of poor households through the ID-Poor survey process.  The MOH works closely with the Council for Agriculture and Rural Development, which provides overall coordination of social protection interventions for the poor and informal sector population.  Inter-Ministerial Committee on Combating Counterfeit and Substandard medicines has existed since 2005. The Committee guides the fight against counterfeit and substandard medicines and illegal health services.

VERALL CONCLUSION

While improvements in health outcomes in the last ten years can be partly attributed to the consistent improvement in socio-economic conditions, a reduction in poverty levels and improved social conditions (including housing, clean water supply and sanitation), undeniably, a significant contributor has been the improved performance of a stronger health sector. The expansion of the physical and human resources, infrastructure and

54/147

social health protection schemes have all helped improve coverage and access to health services.

The successful expansion of the health infrastructure along with demand-side changes such as increases in the purchasing capacity, have significantly raised the demand for health care. Meeting this demand will be a key to the future development of the health system. This will mean maintaining a balance in the focus on both equity and quality in service delivery, and health outcomes.

STRATEGIC DIRECTION

7.1

I

NTRODUCTION

The strategic direction sets a long-term broad policy direction for the entire health sector (both public and private sector). It states the strategic intent and constitutes the MoH blueprint for the health sector development for years to come. The Strategic direction is a guiding light for decision-makers, managers and health personnel to lead, manage and operate the health system, so that everyone in all health institutions at national and subnational level moves in the same direction, while carrying out their activities that are directly towards a common vision. It also provides a framework within which health development goals, and strategic objectives and health strategies are formulated. Strategic statements include vision, mission, values and working principles (Figure 7.1). Health strategic plan, with clearly defined goals and objectives, along with targets set and strategies, is developed as means moving towards achieving the strategic intent of the health sector development, so as to improve health outcome of the Cambodian population.

VISION

Vision is an overall inspirational purpose of the MoH envisioning a desired future of health prospect for all Cambodia as resulting from the entire health system development and operations. It motivates and enables individuals to see how their effort contributes to that end.

The RGC during the Fifth Legislature, 2014-2018 will continue to "sustainably develop and strengthen the health sector in order to improve health status and well-being of all Cambodians, especially women and children, the poor and vulnerable peoples, thereby contributing to socio-economic development and poverty reduction in Cambodia." In this regard, a long-term vision of the MoH is:

"All people in Cambodia have better health and wellbeing, thereby contributing to sustainable socio-economic development."

7.3

MISSION

A mission statement spells out the role by which the Ministry of Health steers the development of the strategic intent to serve Cambodian people, with emphasis and concentration on sector priorities and influence on the sector's resources potential and core competencies to achieve defined health development goals. The MoH reaffirms it strong commitment to:

"Effectively managing and leading the entire health sector to ensure that quality health services are geographically and financially accessible and socio-culturally accepted to all people in Cambodia".

7.4

VALUES AND

W

ORKING PRINCIPLES

The MOH will achieve its stated vision and mission through application in motion ethical principles that are guiding the MOH's work. A value-based commitment of the MOH is:

"Rights to health for all people in Cambodia and equity"

Right to health is recognized by the Constitution of the Kingdom of Cambodia. Equal access is not possible given geographical diversity, whereas equal utilization is not necessary without considering need. Equal access to health services according to need is therefore referred to as equity to health, meaning that health services are accessible and available to be used by all population when they need, regardless their socio-economic status and residency, so as improved equitable health outcome among the population.

58/147

Day-to-day management practices and activities of decision-makers, health managers and operational staff in all health institutions at all levels of the health system are guided by the following working principles that are the basis for health service management, including planning, implementing and monitoring all activities and expenditures, and decision-making to ensure that health institutions are operating in a way that is consistent with the MOH vision, mission and values, so as the better health and well-being for all people in Cambodia can be achieved.

Working Principles

Accountability Improving responsiveness and good governance by application of laws and regulations, customs, ethical standards and norms, with emphasis on patient-centered health service delivery.

Efficiency Targeting available resources to the areas of greatest need, especially rural areas and urban poor as well as priority health interventions, with better use of those resources to achieve desired results without having wasted them along the way.

access to and utilization of quality health services, especially by poor and vulnerable people, including persons with disability, and ethnic minorities.

Professionalism Operational and productive health workforce, driven by competencies, ethical behaviour, teamwork, motivation, good working environment and learning processes.

Affordability Ensuring that health services of accepted quality are provided at affordable cost and are financially sustainable.

Sustainability Ensuring that substantial investment and progress made towards improving health are sustained and activities are progressively integrated into the health

Quality

7.5

POLICY

G

OAL

In pursuit of the stated vision, the policy goal is to improve health outcome of the population and provide them with financial risk protection. In order to achieve this ambitious goal, the health sector interventions focus on two fronts: the entire health system (both public and private sector) and the entire population. The former ensures access to and coverage of high quality health services throughout the country, while the latter ensures financial access to the quality health services by all, especially the target population. The policy agenda presented in the Box 7.1 will form a basis for defining strategic interventions on those two fronts over the course of HSP3 implementation.

Box 7.1 Health Policy Agenda

POLICY AGENDA

1. Increase population's access to and utilization of preventive, promotive, curative, and rehabilitative health services that are of an accepted level of quality and are safe.

2. Reduce the financial burden when accessing and utilizing health care services, especially for the poor and vulnerable groups.

3. Increase government health spending while ensuring improved efficiencies for use of available resources.

4. Provide adequate, competency-based, pre- and in-service training for the health workforce, along with strengthening of human resource governance.

5. Health facilities are adequately supplied with medicines and health commodities, medical equipment and technology and resource infrastructure, including buildings, amenities and ICT, to support delivery of essential health services.

6. Strengthen health management information system and disease surveillance system, along with promoting health research and utilization of information for improved health service management.

7. Strengthen institutional capacity with emphasis on regulatory capacity to enforce regulations, promote coordination and public-private partnerships and increase local accountability for health.

BJECTIVES

The desired outcomes (impact level) of the HDGs are used to further define strategic objectives (of the HSP3) and the focus areas of work of the MoH and its subordinates across all levels of the health system. Specific and measurable targets are defined and used to assess progress overtime using measurable indicators. The HDGs are supported by a set of seven strategic objectives with clearly defined indicators (quantitative and qualitative indicators) and targets. Those indicators and targets are presented in Chapter 9 (Strategic Areas).

1. The population will have access to comprehensive, safe and effective quality health services at public and private health facilities. 1.1 Increase coverage and access to quality sexual and reproductive health services, especially for young women, men and adolescents; 1.2 Increase coverage and access to quality antenatal care, delivery, postnatal care, emergency obstetric and neonatal services, and prevention of mother to child HIV transmission from; 1.3 Increase coverage and access to immunization and integrated management of childhood neonatal illnesses, including pneumonia and diarrheal diseases; 1.4 Increase coverage and access to effective nutrition services, thereby reducing protein-energy malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies among women and children under-5 morbidity and mortality caused b 1.5 Eliminate new HIV infections and sustain the reduction in HIV/AIDS-related mortality; 1.6 Improve Tuberculosis case finding and maintain high treatment success rates; 1.7 Ensure zero deaths due to plasmodium falciparum malaria, and reduce dengue mortality; 1.8 Reduce prevalence of parasite infections, including Helminthiasis and other infectious diseases; and 1.9 Strengthen disease surveillance system to reduce morbidity and mortality due to emerging and re-emerging infectious and zoonotic diseases; mortality caused

Stable and sustained financing of healthcare services with increased financial risk protection when accessing healthcare services; 3. The health system will have adequate number of well-trained, competent staff with appropriate skill mix who are well-motivated and display professional ethics. 4. Public health facilities are adequately supplied with medicines, health commodities, equipment and amenities, with effective essential supportive services; 5. Public health facilities have basic infrastructure, appropriate advanced medical equipment and technology and IT; 6. Health and health -related information are reliable, accurate, timely and of high quality and used together with medical and health system research; and 7. Strong health institutional capacity at al levels, including leadership and management competency, together with enforced regulation and local accountability in health.

65/147

TRATEGIC AREAS

Effectively addressing the identified sector priorities requires adequate resource infrastructure - building, amenities, medicines and health commodities, medical equipment and technology, competent and well-motivated health workforce, together with credible budget and sustained financing sources, robust health management information system, and good governance including effective regulation and coordination etc.- that are of essential input to support improved access to and utilization of quality health services by the population. In this regard, strategic interventions in pursuit of achieving strategic objectives are structured around seven cross-cutting strategic areas for health system interventions, namely health service delivery (HSD), health system financing (HSF), health workforce development (HWD), essential support systems (ESS), health infrastructure development (HID), health information system (HIS) and health system governance (HSG) (Figure 8.1). It is envisioned that the achievement of HDGs is directly impacted by outcome/results of HSD strategies that are attributable to consolidated results of strategic interventions falling within the other strategic areas. Each strategic area is described in turn in the next section 9.

NTRODUCTION

To effectively address the identified sector priorities, adequate resources will be required. This includes physical infrastructure, medicines and health commodities, medical equipment and technology, competent health workforce, adequate and sustained financial resources, robust health management information system, and effective governance. These are the essential inputs required to support improved access and utilization of quality health services by the population.

As described previously, the strategic interventions have been structured around seven cross-cutting strategic areas, namely health service delivery (HSD), health system financing (HSF), health workforce development (HWD), essential support systems (ESS), basic infrastructure development (BID), health information system (HIS) and health system governance (HSG) . It is envisioned that the achievement of HDGs is directed impacted by performance results of HSD strategies that are attributable to consolidated results of strategic interventions falling within the other strategic areas.

A key feature of a well-functioning health system is equitable access to quality health

services that is responsive to population needs. For the health system to be effective, it is

important that it offers a wider range of quality assured interventions related to health and

associated domain. These services should be aimed at further reducing maternal and child

mortality, reducing the burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases and

addressing other major public health problems. Consequently, strengthening health

service delivery is critical to ensure that all Cambodians have equity access to services of

acceptable quality, irrespective of their demographic or socioeconomic characteristics.

Affordable access to quality-assured medicines and health technologies is critical for functioning health systems and fundamental for improving health outcomes. Health technologies equip health care providers with tools that are indispensable for effective and efficient prevention, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation and attainment of health-related development goals. Adequate human resources, sustainable financing, rational selection and use and reliable supply system are key components to ensure uninterrupted availability and accessibility of essential medicines and to avoid wastage of products and funds. Effective medicines and medical product regulation and registration is necessary to protect patients and systems from medical products with compromised quality, safety and efficacy which result in inadequate or no treatment and contributions to drug resistance and economic burden.

HEALTH SERVICE DELIVERY STRATEGY

10.1

I

NTRODUCTION

Effective and efficient health service delivery is essential for the health system to improve lives and produce beneficial health outcomes. In fact, the performance of the health system is determined by its ability to provide services that are accessible (encourages utilization of the services by the beneficiaries); acceptable (of adequate quality to produce desired health benefits); affordable (promotes efficient use of available resources); and equitable (address barriers to service access). These are essential elements for all levels of service delivery not only to produce the potential benefits, but also to counter underperformance.

10.2

GUIDING PRINCIPLES

The development of health service delivery strategies and strategic interventions is guided by a set of the following principles.

 Effective approach to health service delivery: a comprehensive range of health services are appropriately provided to meet the health needs of the population, especially target population, including preventative, curative, palliative and rehabilitative services and health promotion activities, along with effective referral services.

 Increase access to and coverage of MPA and CPA health services: a wide range of health services as defined in MPA and CPA guidelines (including outreach and referral system) are made more available, so that all peoples in a defined catchment area of HC and RH are covered.

 Continuous improvement in quality health services: health services provided evidence-based interventions, effective and safe, and given in a timely manner at an affordable cost, so as to ensure "better-value for money" and improve health outcome of the population.

77/147

 Promote providers' and clients' right: making health services more patient-oriented; promoting awareness of patients' rights to health and appropriate health seeking behaviour; and promoting awareness of health providers' rights and responsibilities, and improving their ethical practice.

 Strengthen accountability: health service delivery is well managed, regulated and coordinated, so as health facilities can achieve health goals without having wastage of resources, and held accountable for results.

 Well-coordinated health service delivery: networks of health service delivery are effectively coordinated, across types of provider including other social services and partners (e.g. private, community-based organizations, NGOs).

HEALTH SYSTEM FINANCING STRATEGY

11.1

I

NTRODUCTION

A long-term vision of health system financing is to enable active socio-economic participation of all residents of Cambodian through a health system that provides universal access to an essential package of quality health interventions in a regulated health market, thereby providing protection against impoverishment due to ill health. In addition to the existing health challenges, an ageing population together with rising prevalence of NCDs place increasing demands on the health systems. For households these changes in demographic and health patterns may eventually translate in excessive, necessitating a strengthened social health protection system.

11.2

GUIDING PRINCIPLES

The development of health financing strategies and strategic interventions is guided by a set of the following principles.

 Equity in access and in financing: ensure access to essential curative, preventive, promotive, and rehabilitative health services by the population, regardless their capacity-to-pay, cash at hand, and residency. Lack of cash money should not be a reason for not seeking care and for denying providing quality healthcare services.

 Financial risk protection: ensure that poor and vulnerable people are covered by social health protection mechanisms and together with the rest of the population do not

82/147

incur excessive costs when using health services. Financing the health system includes mechanisms to minimize catastrophic and impoverishing health spending and maximizes equity.

 Quality healthcare services: healthcare services shall be effective, provided in an efficient way and acceptable to the population.

 Good governance: health system financing follows rules and procedures, is responsive to present and future needs of the population and predictable in amount and timing, irrespectively of source of money.

 Accountability and client oriented: health providers are accountable for quality and safety of health services that must be adhered to nationally defined quality standards and delivered with respect to clients/patients' right.

I

NTRODUCTION

A well-functioning health system should ensure equitable access to essential support services such as medical products, vaccines and technologies. The availability of these services is critical for the health system to serve its objective of saving lives, reducing sufferings and improving population health outcomes. But for the health system to be able to have these support services, they must be available at an affordable cost, and be of assured quality and feasibility so that it can be properly used both by providers and patients. They should be available at all times to ensure continuity of services for population use. Thus, they should be selected based on the real needs, cost-effectiveness and suited to the available fiscal space. These services should be able to promote equity in access without comprising on the cost or quality.

APPROACH TO IMPLEMENTATION

17.1

I

NTRODUCTION

Health planning has had a long history. AOP and its annual process were first introduced in 1999 and subsequently became routine activity for all health institutions. A fundamental strength of the process is that it is fully owned, led and managed by the MoH, with strong support from Development Partners (DPs). Alignment of DPs funds is a key aspect of the Cambodian approach to the health sector financing under "Sector-wide Management" (SWiM), aiming at putting development assistance behind the national health priorities and strategies.

HSP3 strategies will be translated into implementation via the national planning and budgeting process. Operational plans will be developed and updated on annual basis by using the national planning and budgeting instruments i.e. a 3-year-rolling Public Investment Program (PIP) and Budget Strategic Plan (BSP) and the health sector Annual Operational Plan (AOP) including annual budget. (Figure17.1).

PLANNING FOR HEALTH SECTOR FINANCING

Joint Annual Performance Review (JAPR) and Joint Annual Planning Appraisal (JAPA) are recognized as mechanisms for improving alignment of health partners' support with the national health priorities. In addition, the Technical Working Group for Health (TWGH) at the sectoral level and Provincial Technical Working Group for Health (Pro-TWGH) at the provincial level can be used as a mechanism for policy dialogue and promoting coordination. Box 17.1 presents key feature of TWGH.

A large proportion of DPs fund is dedicated to supporting the implementation of the HSP. Those funds flow partly into the health sector under "program-based approach" and partly directly into agreed priority interventions (defined group of activities) in HSP. The

112/147

MOH has adopted flexible funding modalities, which allow DPs to choose funding mechanism that best suits them. Figure 17.2 depicts an overview of funding mechanisms from all available sources to support the implementation of the HSP (MoH's official letter dated 23

rd

March 2007 to DPs: Decisions on Options for Moving to SWAPs in the Health Sector). In practice, some DPs contribute to the pooled fund while others to non-pooled or discrete funding mechanisms. The second Health Sector Support Program (2009-2015), for example, involved both pooled and discrete funding arrangements. Use of the national systems for DP-supported program will be explored and implemented, when and where appropriate.

17.3

PRINCIPLES FOR PLANNING

An approach to health planning is a combination of top-down and bottom-up planning. The provincial level is the interface between top-down and bottom-up planning. It is via this mechanism that institutional knowledge, operational and site-specific expertise of managers is communicated to the central ministry and across the health sector. The annual health plan development is guided by four guiding principles:

 Team approach. Health managers work together as a team to organize their present and future resources to provide and improve health service delivery for the population. That is very important, because resources are often limited and therefore managers need to set priorities and make choices. Roles of the Planning Team are described in Box 16.1.

 Participatory process. All concerned stakeholders in and outside health institution should participate in a series of activities recommended in annual planning process. In doing so, each implementing unit/concerned stakeholder is provided an opportunity to influence broader resource allocation, and maintain its

own operational control over use of resources allocated, as well as accountability for the results.

 Resources-based planning. It is a process that puts human and financial resources at the forefront. A starting point is to identify available resources prior to the development of AoP, including planned budget. As such the process requires reliable and up-to-date resources information to guide rational decisions on the resource allocation and use.

 Program-based budgeting. This budgeting approach links the planned expenditures to clearly determined results. For management purpose, each program is broken down into several subprograms and activities. Programs' performance can be measured in terms of outcomes; outputs; and cost. In this regard, managers/planners need to identify group of main activities that support priority interventions.

NSTRUMENTS

114/147

There are a set of planning and budgeting tools that are currently used in the health sector and across the Government ministries/agencies. Those instruments are: Public Investment Program, Budget Strategic Plan and Annual Budget Plan (ABP). In the health sector ABP is an integral part of AOP. These documents are prepared in line with the Government's overarching macroeconomic policy, socioeconomic development agenda of the RGC's Rectangular Strategy, and the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP), and used, by Ministry of Economy & Finance to guide annual budget allocation across the Government ministries and agencies.

Public Investment Programs

The RGC has introduced PIPs since 1995 and the Ministry of Planning is the lead-ministry, responsible for preparation of this annual, rolling and three-year program, focusing on capital and technical assistance required to implement development strategies of the RGC. A key feature of PIP process is "one-to-one consultation" with many ministries and agencies in order to ensure that the planned investment in a line sector is appropriately addressing the national priorities (NSDP). In addition, the process allows collecting inputs from DPs.

The preparation of the health sector PIPs is "a top-down planning". The Department of Planning & Health Information is responsible for annual update of PIPs based on input provided by the MOH relevant departments and national centers, and to some extent from health partners. The health sector PIPs directly addresses not only the national priorities, but also the health sector priorities as identified in the health strategic plan.

Budget Strategic Plan

The RGC has introduced BSP in 2011 with a medium term horizon that will incorporate the sector annual budget plan, and together with PIPs, constitutes the core strategy for medium to long term planning. BSP is seen as medium term planned expenditure framework. The health sector BSP is built upon the HPS3's medium term HDGs and strategic objectives, and also based on the sector's financing needs (bottom-up planning) and projections of available resource envelope from all sources (domestic and external - top down). The bottom-up costs and top-down resource envelope will be matched in the context of the annual planning and budget process to inform resource allocation decisions on priorities, both within and across sectors. The sector BSP is prepared by the MoH Budgeting Team, whose roles are presented in Box 16. 3.

Box 16.3. Roles of MOH Budgeting Team

 Prepare/update BSP for the central & provincial level  Define program structures, identify targets and indicators, and forecast resources required

 Conduct budget analysis and prepare justification for budget negotiation

 Examine approaches to sector budget allocation

 Monitor and evaluate the implementation of PBB and prepare quarterly/yearly budget report

UDGETING PROCESSES

PIP/BSP process is "rolling-forward" over every year in order to incorporate changes (changing policy, needs and resources) and take into account progress made and new priorities as informed by APR/JAPR, but not for major deviations from the HSP3 strategy or momentums already set. If appropriately applied, the process will considerably improve allocation and predictability of funding for the health sector and link allocated resources with outcomes of health service delivery. Within PIP/BSP framework, AOP can then be developed with clearly defined operational objectives and detailed activities (including budget) and timetable. The following Section focuses mainly on BSP and AOP process.

Annual Planning/budgeting Cycle

The AOP process is an ambitious and labor-intensive one, incorporating top-down and bottom-up processes, in which individual ODs (with input from health centres and referral hospitals), PHDs, Central MoH departments, and national hospitals and national centers/institutions prepare its activity plan and its budget for the year. There are seven steps in the annual health planning cycle (Figure 17.2).

Figure 17.2 Annual Health Planning Cycle

1. Situational analysis (annual performance review)

2. Priority-setting (review goals, objectives & targets)

3. Developing program & subprogram activities and budget (AoP document) 4. Appraisal & feedback 5. Finalizing AoP 6. Implementation & Monitoring 7. Evaluation

Step1. Situational Analysis (where are we now?)

Annual review

Step2. Priority-setting (what do we want to achieve?)

This stage involves a hierarchy of HDGs, strategic objectives and targets as

defined in the HSP3, and also programs' operational objectives. Priorities

setting should also be based on factors such as feasibility in context of the socio-political climate, and within the available resources.

KEY FEATURES OF PRIORITY-SETTING



Step3. Programming & budgeting: (how do we achieve what we want?)

Identify planned activities over the year for program, each with a budget.

Step4. Appraisal and feedback

In the 3 rd

quarter of the year, a Joint Annual Plan Appraisal (JAPA) workshop is conducted with central institutions and provincial health departments joined by health development partners to appraise and finalize next year's AOP.

Step5. Implementation

Concerns transformation of program activities into specific timed and budgeted sets of tasks and activities with development of work plans (monthly and quarterly work plans).

Step6. Monitoring

Monitoring of the implementation of the program activities is conducted through monthly and quarterly progress review meetings at each level and mid-year progress review at sectoral level.



Quarterly Progress Review (QPR)

 Mid-Year Review (MYR): The MoH also conducts a MYR in which the first semester's progress against targets down to OD level is analyzed and necessary changes made, along with resource reallocation if required.

The Program-Based Budget (PBB) is budgeting approach that shifts a focus on input and output to outcome and results (health service delivery). The PBB structure comprises of three levels as illustrated in Figure XX. Program structure hierarchy will be reviewed periodically, when and where appropriate.

Figure 2: Program Structure Hierarchy

 A budget program: is designated to a clearly defined set of services, whereby core permissive and obligatory functions (mainly service delivery function and management function) of MoH and its subordinates, are delivered. MoH has defined four budget programs as follows:

 Program 1: Reproductive , Maternal and newborn, child health and nutrition  Program 2: Communicable disease control  Program 3: Non-communicable disease control & public health problems  Program 4: Health system strengthening

 A budget sub-program comprises a distinct grouping of services and activities within the scope of a budget program. For management purposes a budget subprogram is identified separately within the budget program.

 A operation budget is for main activities that are on-going and/or to be undertaken in delivering the budget program or budget sub-program. The main activities are developed based on strategic interventions as identified in the HSP.

Timetable for Annual Planning and Budgeting

The annual planning and budgeting process occurs across all levels of the health system. Plan and budget preparation and consolidation are very time-consuming and require specific knowledge and expertise of health managers/planners. Table 16.1 indicates time sequence that is relevant to main activities in the process.

PROGRAM PLANNING & BUDGETING

18.1

I

NTRODUCTION

The programming and budgeting framework describes structure, process, and tools to guide the development of annual operational plan including annual budget plan according to the annual operational plan structures that are properly aligned with the program-based budget. The framework consists of four program areas and its operational objectives, with clearly defined indicators and targets. The sector strategies are the basis for developing the program strategies/interventions and activities that are fully supported by estimated cost as guided by BSP and PBB guidelines.

The program planning and budgeting have to be directed towards the achievements of the stated operational objectives, and the broader strategic objectives set forth in the HSP3.

18.2

GUIDING PRINCIPLES

(The extent to which its sub-programs and activities have contributed to the advancement of the strategic objective) outcomes; outputs (the goods and services provided under the program which can be measured in terms of quantity, quality and timeliness); and cost.

Each programme therefore can be described in terms of the objective it seeks to achieve, the strategies it employs to impact on the objective, the outputs to be delivered in pursuing the strategies and the inputs used in the production of outputs.

(BSP principles/MoEF)

18.3

PROGRAM

B

UDGET

INVESTMENT

Plan becomes realistic, when it is supported by realistic estimated budget. Intended objectives can be achieved; once the plan is truly put into the implementation and committed resources (budget and staff) are made available on timely manner and wisely used, without having wasted along the way, to carry out planned activities as scheduled.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION

19.1

I

NTRODUCTION

The monitoring and evaluation framework outlines

structure

and

process

for measurement and accountability for results in the implementation of the HSP3. Progress and achievements of the HSP3 implementation will be reviewed and updated on regular basis throughout the lifespan of the plan by measuring input, output and outcome indicators of the health system performance against targets set in pursuit of strategic objectives, ultimately of achieving Health Development Goals.

The framework will further strengthen monitoring and evaluation system by linking inputs with implementation, then with outputs, and finally with outcomes and impacts. The monitoring and evaluation system focuses on the seven domains or strategic areas (health service delivery, physical infrastructure development, essential support systems, health system financing, health workforce development, and health information system and health system governance) and at four levels (input/process, output, outcome, and impact).

19.2

MONITORING AND EVALUATION FRAMEWORK

Guiding principles for M & E framework

The monitoring and evaluation framework promotes use of both qualitative and quantitative information for evidence-based decision-making. It envisions that the MoH and DPs will use the framework to review the progress in the health sector on a regular basis to gain information for health service management, planning and decision-making.

 Clarity

 Reliability

 Sensitivity

 Accountability  Sustainability

125/147

The purpose of the framework is threefold:

 To monitor and evaluate health sector performance in improving health status;  To refine existing health policies considering the progress made; and  To enable policy-makers to determine the effectiveness of different policy alternatives

Figure 19.1 Monitoring and Evaluation Framework

19.3

MONITORING &

E

VALUATION PROCESS

Monitoring occurs at all level of the health system and is an integral part of the annual health planning process as indicated in Figure 17.3. AoP including annual performance indicators and Quarterly Work Plan are basic tools to support monitoring exercises.

Figure 19.2

depicts steps for establishing M & E plan.

 Define questions for M & E  Identify indicators and data sources to answer the defined questions  Identify institutions/implementing units responsible for data collection, analysis and reporting

 Set timeframe for M & E

HEALTH MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM, ADMINISTRATIVE RECORDS, DEMOGRAPHIC AND HEALTH SURVEY….

126/147

 Finally, establish M & E Plan, including estimated cost to implement the plan

< Figure 19.2 Overview of Monitoring & Evaluation Process>

National Indicators Framework

The national indicators framework presented in Table 18.1 is a tool for the national and subnational level MoH to monitor and evaluate the health sector performance. These indicators are developed based on the HSP3 priorities. The framework will be modified periodically to ensure that the information collected is useful for informing policy-makers and program managers. It also links key questions with the best available information to help policy-makers, health planners and managers make informed decisions about competing policy and strategy alternatives over the course of the HSP3 implementation.

DATA

S

OURCES

Monitoring and evaluation process requires a strong health management information system (HMIS) that provides real-time and high quality health data, and better institutional capacity at all levels to carry out effectively monitoring functions. The later includes data collection, compilation, analysis and reporting, as well as use monitoring results to support decision-making for improving health service management and planning.

As monitoring process is an integral part of the annual health planning processes, all MoH departments and program may collect additional information to manage and monitor their programs. Likewise the PHDs/ODs may also collect additional information on key indicators for operational and service planning. Data on indicators for provincial management and services are submitted annually to the MoH Department of Planning & Health Information. Some national level indicators are collected at provincial level and therefore serve two purposes: informing national policy and monitoring provincial planning.

Health and health-related data currently are collected through a number of reliable sources. These include, but are not limited to:

 Facility-based reporting (HMIS and PMRS), annual health financing report, National Health Account Report, annual report on human resource development,  Population-based reporting (Census, CDHS and CSES)-periodically 3-5 years interval; providing, demographic information,  Other sources: administrative and financial records, assessment/study/research findings .etc.

Health Management Information System

HMIS is web-based application and also health-facility based reporting system. The key features of HMIS are:

 Its integration; implying one system for routine health data, standardization in terms of the same set of forms applied across each level.

 Simplicity of design; retaining historical data, incorporating new information; reliability in terms of completeness and timeliness of data; and computerization to all referral hospitals and 25% of health centers, where internet access, electricity and computer facilities are available.

 Its components; including monthly routine reports from health centers (form HC1) and referral hospitals (HO2).

131/147

 Data are aggregated, covering (but not report on logistics, administration, finance or patient vital statistics):

 Outpatient and in-patient services, other preventive services e.g. immunizations, birth spacing, deliveries, and laboratory examinations, referrals

 Health problems such as illnesses and conditions. All patient data are reported in a disaggregated form containing patients geographical location, age and sex.

 Most of services output and outcome indicators (access and coverage) listed in the national indicators framework are available in HMIS.
