Education Strategic Plan

2014-2018

March 2014

Preface

The Royal Government of Cambodia has the ambition to transition from a lower-middle income country to being an upper-middle income country by 2030 and a developed country by 2050. The immediate and future economic growth and competitiveness of the nation to realize the ambitions depends on our people having the right knowledge and relevant skills, reflecting our cultural and ethical heritage.

The education sector plays an important role in the national development. The children, youth and adults will receive education and lifelong learning services with high quality, which are relevant and responsive to the labor market demand. In order to realize in full the benefits of Cambodia's demographic dividend there has to be a focus on building skills for learning and providing opportunities for access to technical and specialized skills for all.

The Education Strategic Plan (ESP) 2014-2018 has been designed to respond to these demands and makes clear the relationship between national policy and the education policy. The Plan demonstrates a logical relationship between the strategic framework, programs, activities and both human and financial resources. There is provision for strong monitoring and evaluation, feedback and adjustment to the plan if needed.

The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport (MoEYS) will continue to give a high priority to equitable access for high quality basic education services. The ESP 2014-2018 has an increasing focus on the expansion of Early Childhood Education, expanding access to quality secondary and post-secondary education and Non-Formal Education, Technical and Vocational Education. Specific measures will be taken to assure the education for marginalized children and youth. In order to provide focus, accountability and clear outcomes the ESP builds around seven key sub-sectors: Early Childhood Education, Primary Education, Secondary and Technical Education, Higher Education, Non-Formal Education, Youth Development and Physical Education and Sport.

Within the context of decentralization, providing the education system with the right resources and the mechanisms to account transparently is crucial to improving the outcomes and impact of the education activities. The ESP 2014-2018 includes measures to improve the budget management and to better linking results to financial resources. Rigorous implementation of the Teacher Code of Conduct, developing the capacity of staff at all levels for effective implementation against clear standards will lead to better governance. In order to support this, we will continue to implement the strengthening of the partnership between the Government and communities and parents, the development partners, the private sector and non-governmental organizations.

Introduction and Analysis on performance in 2009-2013

1.1

Introduction: Education Sector Performance 2009-2013

Over the period of the implementation of Education Strategic Plan (ESP) 2009-2013, Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport (MoEYS) has made considerable progress in improving the opportunities all Cambodian children have to access education, in enhancing the quality of the children's learning experiences and becoming an efficient and effective deliverer of education services.

The ESP 2009-2013 identified 3 Policy areas for strategic focus:

 Policy 1: Ensuring equitable access to education services

 Policy 2: Improving quality and efficiency of educational services

 Policy 3: Institutional and capacity development for educational staff for decentralization

The following sections summarize the achievements under the current ESP 2009-2013 and identify where the focus for the work of the next 5 year strategic plan will be. The section analysis draws on the ESP Mid Term Review completed in 2012, the outcome of the Annual Joint Technical Working Group-Education Retreats and the sub-sector reviews carried out in 2012 and 2013.

In order to monitor these policy areas 6 Core Breakthrough Indicators were identified, the indicators and progress are given in Table 1.

Overall good progress has been made. However, there remain several areas where progress has been less than anticipated and which remain to be addressed. These challenges become more specific when the data is disagregated by Province and by District. Some Provinces, despite having made good progress from a very low base are still falling below the expected norms. Of particular concern are the outcomes for secondary education where enrolment and completion rates for lower secondary are markedly less that expected. Over the period of the ESP 2009-2013, the data collection capacity and analysis has continued to improve and with the increasingly reliable and detailed data it has been and will be possible to better target specific interventions to specific challenges.

1.2 Analysis on Access to Education

Figure 1 shows the population of school age children for lower secondary and upper secondary levels, has remained fairly constant between 2008-2009 and 2012-2013 around 1 million population. There has been a decline in primary aged children in the population from 1,895,209 to 1,761,825.

The population trend is reflected in the Gross Enrolment Rate (GER) in primary education, which has also remained relatively constant between 2009-2010 and 2012-2013 (figure 1). NER has increased marginally at all levels of education. Primary NER has reached 97.0% and should not be expected to increase significantly in future years as it progresses towards 100% (figure 2). At the primary level, there has likely been a gradual correction over time whereby the number of correctly school aged children gradually increased towards full participation whilst the number of incorrectly aged children has likely decreased.

Figure 1: Population by age bracket for each level of education (2008-2009 to 2012-2013)

Figure 2: Gross Enrolment Rate (GER) and Net Enrolment Rate (NER) 2009-2010 to 2012-2013

As the maps below show, NER in primary education has improved across the provinces. In SY 2012-2013, all provinces showing above 90% NER and ten Provinces with more than 97% NER.

Figure 3: NER in primary education in SY 2009-2010 and SY 2012-2013

Figure 3 shows the distribution of primary urban and rural GER and NER between 2009-2010 and 2012-2013. Both GER and NER have declined significantly in urban areas. In line with the trends for total GER and NER, GER has marginally increased in rural areas while NER has significantly increased which may indicate greater access to education in rural areas as well as an improvement in the efficiency of the system with more children of the correct age enrolled.

As the maps below show, gross enrolment rate in lower secondary has not increased as had been hoped but decreased in some provinces.

Figure 6: GER in Lower Secondary Education in SY 2009-2010 and SY 2012-2013

Figure 6 shows lower secondary urban and rural GER have declined. Urban Lower Secondary GER has declined while rural lower secondary GER has slightly decreased during the same period perhaps reflecting a greater number of rural schools.

Figure 7 and 8 show the same trend in declining both GER at upper secondary education in urban and rural schools.

1.3 Analysis on Internal Efficiency

Repetition rates at all levels have decreased, especially in primary education has decreased from 9.0% in SY 2008-2009 to 5.3% in SY 2011-2012. In lower and upper secondary education, repetition rates have slightly decreased down to 1.5% and 1.7% in SY 2011-2012.

Figure 9: Repetition rate by level of education 2008-2009 to 2011-2012

As the maps show Repetition rates have decreased significantly with all but one Province having rates higher than 10%. Figure 9 shows that for primary level rates have more than halved between 2008-2009 and 2011-2012 from 8.9% to 5.3%. Nevertheless, as seen in the maps and figures in the next section the numbers of dropouts remain high which results in considerable wastage at all levels of the education system.

Stung Treng has the highest primary repetition rates at an average of 13.6% followed by Preah Vihear at 9.7%. Kep has the lowest repetition rate at 1.6%.

Figure 11: Dropout rates in Primary education by provinces in SY 2008-2009 and SY 2011-2012

Drop out in primary level has showed a marked improvement over the last ESP period. Figure 11 show that dropout rate varies significantly between provinces. Dropout rates are not consistent between levels of education.

1.4 Challenges

Chapter 2 National Development Priority and Educational Policy 2014-2018

2.1 The National Development Context

Vision 2030: Building a Sustainable, Competitive and Harmonious Economy

The Royal Government's vision is to build a Cambodian society which is peaceful, with political stability, security and social order; a prosperous nation with long-term economic growth, sustainable and equitable development, enhanced livelihoods of people, and reduced poverty incidence; a society which is committed to environmental protection, enhanced culture and national identity which firmly adheres to the principles of multi-party democracy and shows respect for human rights and dignity; and an advanced society with well-connected social fabrics and well-educated and culturally advanced population who enjoy a good standard of living and live in harmony both within the society and family; and a noble nation with high reputation in international for a and a full-fledged member of the international community.

Cambodia aspires to reach the status of an upper-middle income country by 2030 and a high-income country by 2050. The Royal Government has set out four strategic objectives 1) ensuring an average annual economic growth of 7%; 2) creating more jobs for people especially the youth; 3) achieving more than 1 percentage point reduction in poverty incidence annually and 4) further strengthening institutional capacity and governance at both national and sub-national levels.

The Royal Government will focus on human resource development to ensure competitiveness in an increasingly open regional labor market through 1) training of skilled and productive labor to meet market demand and increase value added; 2) building educational and vocational training institutions and developing regulatory frameworks; 3) encouraging private sector participation; 4) strengthening the quality of education and promoting scientific research, technology development and innovation.

2.2 National Development Policies and Priorities

In response to the National Vision, the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) 2014 - 2018 makes clear how Cambodia will respond to ASEAN integration in 2015 and lay the foundations for becoming a middle income country in 2030. In order to promote public service delivery and local development, the Government is committed to transfer roles and responsibilities to sub-national councils. In the long term, these unified administrations will coordinate all administrative activities, including those of the Ministries' line offices7 The process to gradually transfer roles and responsibilities is reflected in the MoEYS policy on decentralization and de-concentration reform.

The development of human resources with quality, ability and virtue is a key factor to support economic growth and the country's competitiveness in the future especially as Cambodia is a low middle income country and aims to be a high average income country in 2030 and a developed country in 2050. To this purpose, human resource development as the building of knowledge, competence, entrepreneurship, skills, creativity and innovation in all sectors but especially science and technology and the ability to manage research and development is essential. At the same time the aim is to enhance in the population the quality of the health, moral and spiritual responsibility, patriotic and professional consciousness with zero gender discrimination.

Development of high quality and capable human resources to meet the immediate and long-term needs of economic growth and improving competitiveness during Cambodia's socioeconomic development remains a challenge for the Royal Government. In education, it is required to particularly focus on strengthening the quality and responsiveness to labor market demand and the development of technical skills for youth to increase their job opportunities and to realize in full the benefits of Cambodia's demographic dividend as well as to ensure continuity in the country's leadership development for the future.

2.3 Vision and Mission of the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport

The MOEYS vision is to establish and develop human resources of the very highest quality and ethically sound in order to develop a knowledge-based society within Cambodia.

In order to achieve the above vision, MOEYS has the mission of leading, managing and developing the Education, Youth and Sport sector in Cambodia in responding to the socioeconomic and cultural development needs of its people and the reality of regionalization and globalization.

A long-term objective of the MOEYS is to achieve the holistic development of Cambodia's young people. In addition, the Ministry intends to engender a sense of national and civic pride, high moral and ethical standards and a strong belief in young people's responsibility for the country and its citizens.

The MOEYS's immediate objective is to ensure that all Cambodian children and youth have equal opportunity to access quality education consistent with the Constitution and the Royal Government's commitment to the UN Child Rights Convention, regardless of social status, geography, ethnicity, religion, language, gender and physical form. The Ministry envisages a time when graduates from all its institutions will meet regional and international standards and will be competitive in the job markets worldwide and act as engines for social and economic development in Cambodia.

Cambodia has passed into new development stage of education with a need to focus on strengthening basic education and quality within a comprehensive national economic framework. Long-term education vision of Cambodia will focus on all aspects of ECE, to provide a strong foundation for other levels of education. It will focus on students at early grades of primary education especially building reading and mathematics skills. The education sector will expand its scope of Education for All from primary education 6 years to 9 years basic education. Graduates from basic education will be traced upon their strength to select general secondary education or technical and vocational education. The strengthening of quality will focus on the quality of inputs, teaching and learning processes and student achievement. There will also be a focus on the qualification of teachers who will be upgraded from 12+2 to 12+4 in 2020. And focus on the quality of curriculum at general education and higher education according to the ASEAN quality standards.

2.4 Approach for the ESP 2014-2018

The fact of ASEAN integration in 2015 and the desire of Cambodia to be a middle income country by 2030 require considerable investment in education. Both professional and well qualified human resources and financial resources are required (highly successful ASEAN countries have grown in part as a result of the high level of education investment often in excess of 5% of gross domestic product GDP).

MoEYS recognizes the importance of making the whole of the sector work together in order to respond to the social and economic demands. The focus of the ESP 2014 - 2018 is on consolidating the gains already made in the previous ESP periods, reaching out to the most disadvantaged, providing learning that is of a high quality and relevant to the national development. Education services are delivered professionally and accountably in order to lay a foundation for knowledge and skills based economy. The sector will develop its sector wide quality assurance framework based on learning and service delivery standards that respond to the needs of children, communities and the labor market.

The ESP will focus on results in the 7 key sub-sectors of early childhood education, primary education, secondary and technical education, higher education, non-formal education, youth development and physical education and sport.

The tasks of these sub-sectors, including the development of teachers, improving the curriculum and learning and teaching materials, preparing quality assurance framework, decentralization and deconcentration will be supported by the human resources and financial management systems.

Chapter 3 Sub-sector Planning 2014-2018

Chapter 3: Sub-sector Planning Page [17]

3.1 Early Childhood Education

3.1.1 Background

There has been some progress in access to ECE services with 56.49% of five years old accessing services in SY 2012-2013 (35% in SY 2008-2009) and 21.23 % of 3-4 years old accessing in 2012. Little attention has so far been paid to the 0- below 3 years old age group which is 3.19%.

The expansion of community preschools, preschool within primary school, private preschool and home based care programs has supported this progress, but coverage remains limited due to scare physical and financial resources and limited capacity. The quality of and demand for services remain low and there remains a large gap in coverage for those geographical areas where there is low admission and enrolment and high dropout rates in primary schools. The sub-sector has provided little focus on nutrition, care and health.

Currently there is no quality assurance framework and only public preschool teachers teaching 5 year olds have received in-service training in teaching to the current curriculum; there has been limited training provided to community preschool teachers and 'core mothers' for the Home Based Care program; learning and teaching materials are limited and developing community preschool facilities has not been a priority.

The policy interventions during the 2009-2013 period have laid a strong foundation for a quality expansion of ECE to 2018. These are the development of Early Childhood Care and Development Policy, the National ECCD Action Plan, the ECCD National Committee, a Prakas for managing private preschools and a Prakas for recognition of ECCD national core trainers and sub-national core trainers.

3.2 Primary Education

3.2.1 Background

Children's access to primary school has improved, with the net enrollment rate improving from 94.8% in SY 2008-2009 to 97% in SY 2012-2013 with no gender disparity, repetition rates have fallen and student drop out has declined. A number of incomplete primary schools have been completed. Disability screening and out of school children studies have been conducted. Thousands of schools in 12 provinces implement school feeding programs. 50% of primary schools have the washing hand space. 80.2% have toilets and 58.5% have water using. Moreover, some materials such as the first aids box, barrel, clean water, trash, have provided to some of primary schools.

Most primary schools operate using the child friendly school policy. Tools to assess learning achievement have been developed and show that student learning has improved, especially for Khmer language in the early grades. Bilingual education is being expanded as are accelerated learning classes and the multi-grade teaching approach. 15,000 scholarships have been provided to poor children in primary schools. The development of 600 schools has been supported using school improvement grants (a program that will be expanded nationwide in school year 2013-2014) and thousands of teachers have been trained in effective teaching and learning.

The role of District Education Office is now key to supporting the effective functioning of service delivery and the District Training and Monitoring Teams (DTMT) modality has been established to provide timely support to schools with National Core Trainers being formally assigned to provide supports to DTMT and schools.

Geographical disparity and incomplete primary schools still limits the access of children to schools and prevents right age access to school where overage students learning achievements are known to be lower than that for the right age students.

There remains considerable work to be done to increase the capacity of District Education Officers and DTMT. Many schools require better quality inputs, especially schools in rural areas where the role of communities and parents has to be deepened to address cross-cutting social and economic issues at community and household levels. Teacher performance needs to be regularly monitored and assessed and particularly in rural areas, there remains a gap in the number of qualified teachers needed. Many more school principals need support in leadership and management. Improving data accuracy requires further work and better harmonization between EMIS and a school quality assurance system needs to be developed.

Primary education has been considered as a priority and the large percentage of MoEYS budget allocated to this area needs to be maintained. Good public financial management requires the demonstration of a strong linkage between resources and results.

Several development partners will continue to provide financial and technical support for development of the sub sector: the GPE will develop a program, SIDA provides support through a school improvement grant to every school and EU provides budget support which creates the possibility to increase the school operating budget through PB. The multi donor funded Capacity Development Partnership Fund provides opportunities to strengthen capacity at all levels. WFP will continue the school feeding program. And other DPs and NGOs implement initiative programs which provide input to policy discussion and possible scale up.

3.2.2 Policy objectives

3.3 Secondary and Technical Education

3.3.1 Background

During the 2009-2013 period, a number of policy actions have been taken. The Master Plan for Secondary Education development and the operational manual for Secondary Education Resource School are approved, a Child Friendly School Policy for basic education, and changes in curriculum development. The in-service training systems for math and sciences were developed. The local life skills, ICT, tourism curriculum are approved and library standards for secondary school have been drafted.

The enrolment and the quality of secondary education have improved a little. The repetition rate has decreased slightly but the dropout rate has not changed. More students have selected science subjects at grade 11 and 12; however, the quality of student learning in these subjects is unclear as there is no national assessment test conducted at Grade 12. Scholarships were provided annually. Students achieved Math and Sciences medals from SEAMEO Olympiad and International Olympiad competitions.

National assessment system has been institutionalized and is budgeted for. National examinations for grade 9 and 12 have been regularly conducted.

The number of lower secondary schools and upper secondary schools increased. 50% of lower secondary schools have been upgraded to upper secondary school status. Secondary education resource blocks are established in each province. 141 lower secondary schools in 8 provinces have computer labs. Regional Teacher Training Colleges and National Institute of Education offer pre-service teacher training opportunities and formal in-service basic education teacher training system is being expanded. An in-service training system for math and sciences is ready for expansion. All upper secondary school principals and some lower secondary school principals have participated in leadership and management training. Technical group leaders of Secondary Education Resource School and its networks received training on curriculum standards. The Child Friendly School Policy has been implemented in 823 (50.7%) lower secondary schools. 84.4% of lower secondary school has toilets, 52.9% has clean water usage and 97.7% of upper secondary school has toilets and 64.4% has clean water usage.

The critical challenge for the next ESP is to improve equitable access to secondary education by increasing the number of communes with lower secondary school and so all districts have upper secondary schools. In terms of quality, students graduating from grade 12 need to be improved and relevant knowledge and skills for technical, vocational, and higher education. Many secondary schools, especially schools in rural areas, lack of quality inputs and in some subject areas teachers, teaching materials and equipment, textbooks, sciences labs, computer and language labs and library packages. Teaching style currently characterized by formal lecturing, copying, recitation and memorization will be shifted to encourage thinking and reasoning skills; teacher standards will be implemented to better monitor, appraise and develop teacher performance.

Technical Education is a relatively newly established function in MoEYS and a policy on Technical Education had been approved. This policy mentions the establishment of General Secondary Education and Technical Education High School (GTHS). There are currently 3 GTHSs, which implement four programs. All graduates from the programs can find jobs.

The current technical education program lacks both of strong quality framework and quality inputs. There is neither an accreditation system nor a school quality assurance system and links between the school system and labour market are very limited. A school administrative and financial management system is yet to be developed. Technical education service will

learn from other countries. More development partners are becoming interested in these programs.

3.4 Higher Education

3.4.1 Background

Considerable progress has been made in Higher Education between 2009 and 2013 with 57% increase in student enrolment from 137,253 to 216,053. The number of students in public higher education institutions (HEIs) who received scholarships has doubled from 9,097 to 18,906. However, the share of all scholarships in the total enrolments in public HEIs is actually modest: 16.4% in 2009 and 18.7% in 2013 (an increase of 2.3%). The Directorate General for Higher Education team and HEIs have built their capacity to strengthen planning and monitoring, manage research grants and scholarships and so absorb more funds for programs expansion. A research culture has begun to emerge through the implementation of an innovative research grant program and there is now stronger regional cooperation, collaboration and jointly implemented activities. A number of key policy actions have been taken including the approval of the Research Policy Master Plan, a Royal Decree on Professor ranking and the preparation of the Higher Education Vision 2030. The establishment of the Higher Education Technical Working Group has been an important milestone in establishing a forum for debate and discussion on higher education issues.

A major challenge for the coming years will be to address the mismatch between the needs of the labor market in terms of skills, critical thinking ability and knowledge and the current products on the market. This will require better understanding of the labor market, better coordination and links with industry and better information for students so they can select appropriate courses. Maintaining high quality programs, internationally acceptable certification within an affordable pricing structure is also a challenge. Further work and increased resources will be required to ensure that more talented students from disadvantaged backgrounds can access higher education through scholarship programs or possibly student loan schemes.

The Government has recognized the importance of providing opportunities in higher education and the importance to assuring relevance and quality. ASEAN integration will provide opportunities for collaboration between institutions, joint research and quality standard setting.

3.6 Youth Development

3.6.1 Background

Cambodia considers youth as a key resource and the most valuable for the economic, social, cultural, environmental and peacekeeping development for both current and future. In the social, cultural and political context of Cambodia, the "youth" refer to men and women with Khmer nationality, aged from 15 to 30 years, single or married. According to the general census of the people of Cambodia in 2008, youth have 33 percent of the total number of Cambodian people.

Financing Plan 2014-2018

Chapter 4: Financing Plan 2014-2018 Page [49]

4.1 Public Financial Management Reform

4.1.1 Background

Over the ESP 2009-2013 period, Education Sector PFM development has taken place within the context of the broad Public Finance Management Reform (PFMR) program that is led by the Ministry of Economy and Finance. MOEYS activity has included preparation of a detailed PFMR Ministry Action Plan (MAP); training on Budget Classification and Bookkeeping to all POEs, DOEs and schools and training on fixed asset inventory management to all POEs and selected DOEs and schools.

MOEYS has introduced the Annual Operational Planning process at the national and the provincial levels and continues to refine and improve the content and the process. Program-based budgeting has been effective in providing education establishments with budget resources to be used linked to results. MOEYS has been successful in negotiating an increase in the PB through Prakas 508.

The PFMR Program Phase 3 aimed to improve the relationship between the budget allocation and policies and improved accounting practices by strengthening and expanding the scope of the programme budget preparation and improving the preparation of the budget strategic plan as well as improving the budget implementation and cash management.

Public financial management in the education sector continues to face some challenges - the link between the budget and policy is weak, the overall budget expenditure for the education sector has been very much lower than neighbours countries but despite this some of the annual budget remains unused; the system process are not well-articulated in the context of the structures.

In 2014, public expenditure for MOEYS is in the regions of Riel 1,342 billion (USD 335 million) which represents 16.2% of the Government's current budget. Salary costs account for approximately 75% of total current expenditure. The program budget of approximately Riel 172 billion represents 13% of the current budget. Based on the spending in the 2012 budget, 82% of the education budget is provided to the Provincial level with 18% used at the national level.

In 2014 and in order to improve the mechanisms, particularly in the context of moving to sub sector programing and a stronger focus on results MOEYS will with the strong support of the MEF pilot and initiate a wide range of reforms aimed at building systems and developing the capacity to fully implement medium and long term changes. Amongst these are the implementation of the planned budget by sub - sector focusing on results and on the priority investment program; ensuring reliability and timeliness of cash withdrawal for implementation through units; decentralization of budget following the transfer of functions to local governments; Budget Department quarterly monitoring of budget implementation in order to make amendments to the budget, reviewing the salary levels for managers and administrative officer and capacity building of district education officers; reviewing financial management mechanism and unit prices in the school budget process program.

4.1.2 Policy Objectives

 Adequate resources are available to fully implement the ESP.

 Program outcomes are linked to efficient and effective use of available resources.

 Ensure that education is both affordable and of a high quality.

4.1.3 Strategies

 Strengthen results based planning and budget formulation process at all levels.

 Expand the scope of the computerised FMIS at all levels.

 Expand and institutionalize the use of the banking system.

 Improve efficiency and effectiveness in financial accountability and reporting.

4.1.4 Policy actions

 Inclusion of all activities supported by the budget in 2015.

 Budget entities will be established at departmental level in 2016.

 Pilot the PB audit procedures in 2014 and fully implemented in 2015.

 Inspection procedures introduced in 2014

4.1.5 Outcome indicators

 Integration of result-based planning into the revision of MAP and in the preparation of AOP.

 Annual credible and realistic budget responsive to ESP approved.

 Minimal budget underspend.

 Financial reports are timely prepared and include information and analysis for management's decision-making.

4.1.6 Programs and activities

 The financial management capacity development: The aim is to develop the capacity in result-based planning, operation of the FMIS, improving the participation of Department of Finance in the budgeting process at sub-national levels; improving accounting and reporting autonomy at national and sub-national levels; conducting regular monitoring within all sub-sector and sub-national level on the financial accountability and outcome indicators.

o Strengthening the relationship between policy and budget by including the non-program budgeting into program budgeting. All technical departments will prepare and account for their own budget following the program budgeting approach. Strengthening the finance management, accounting system and FMIS. Preparation of budgetary forecast system for education sector which includes the anticipated current and capital costs.

o Strengthening the FMIS by developing a model of budgetary projection and allocation for the education sector. Developing the expenditure calculation model base on results by sub sector.

o Strengthening the basis for projection and usage of education budget by improving expenditure guidelines and budget regulation. Improving the disbursement and liquidation guidelines. Improving the information system for expenditure projection and analysis.

o Strengthening the budget planning mechanism and finance report system by developing the capacity and resource at DoEs. Improving the salary of administrative staff including school principles.

 Strengthening internal audit: Conduct regular internal audit exercise at national and sub-national levels. Review and revise regulations, principles and norms related to internal audit and management information system development in line with the MEF guidelines and procedures. Pilot and then finalize the internal audit program.

 Strengthening administration and financial inspection: Conduct formal inspection on personnel, administration and financial management, and state properties at national and sub-national levels and in public and private schools. Monitor and make proposals in response to cases related to administration and finance difficulties.

4.2 Budgetary Forecast for the Education Sector

The long-term policy goal for education financing is that no potential students will be excluded from access to education and training opportunities due to inability to pay formal or informal charges or contributions. That the education provided will be relevant to the socio economic and cultural aspirations of the country and of a quality as good as in the best ASEAN countries. A fair and equitable financing mechanism must therefore be put in place taking account of affordability to Government, parents and other potential contributors. It is also important that sufficient information is available to all on education costs in order for stakeholders to effectively judge the value of current and future investments in the sector. An associated objective is to forge the accountability of Government, parents, the private sector and individual service users in the financing of education at all levels.

In the National Strategic Development Plan 2014-2018, the projected overall budget requirement for the education sector increase from 2014 to 2018 up to 3,015 billion Riels in 2018.

ESP 2014-2018 categorizes all development activities into 7 sub-sectors. The overall resource requirement for implementing the ESP 2014-2018 increases from 1,780 billion Riels in 2014 to 3,330 billion Riels in 2018. In the same period, the overall recurrent budget requirement increases from 1,545 billion Riels to 2,924 billion Riels. The capital budget requirement increases from 233 billion Riels in 2014 to 406 billion Riels in 2018. There is a

significant increase in the capital budget requirement in the ESP 2014-2018. The capital budget committed by development partners in the Public Investment Program 2014-2016 will decrease from 430 billion Riels in 2014 to just 260 billion Riels in 2016. Such a decrease is due to the reduced support from DPs for existing projects, which are planned to finish in 2015. However, the government budget, especially the recurrent budget, will continue to account for the budget needs.

4.3 Projected Total Financing Needs and Available Resources

To effectively implement policies and strategies in ESP 2014-2018, MOEYS will continue to work closely with the Ministry of Economy and Finance and Council of Administrative Reform to ensure that medium term expenditure planning for education is consistent with the broader Medium Term Expenditure Framework process and ongoing public financial management reform.

in million dollars -3 14 -21 -78 -80

On this basis, the alternative scenario projects a potential recurrent budget shortfall of around 650 billion Riels from 2014 to 2018. The Ministry would therefore seek an increase in policy-led recurrent budget support from Development Partners or other stakeholders in order to mitigate any risk of financing shortfalls in order to secure a predictable financial base for the sustained ESP reforms.

Overall, the potential total financing gap could amount to around 650 billion Riels (US$ 163 million).

Managing and Monitoring the ESP 2014-2018

Chapter 5: Managing and Monitoring the ESP 2014-2018 Page [53]

5.1 Managing and Implementing the ESP

The national program for sub-national development (NPSNDD), led by the national committee for democratic development (NCDD) will continue to provide the framework for the decentralization and deconcentration activities. During the period ESP 2014 - 2018, sub national change will accelerate, with further transfer of management and cross-sectorial functions to the provincial, municipal, district, community, and school levels. In 2014 there will be pilots in a number of provinces and districts to transfer several functions to local governments. These pilots will assess how the decentralization process can be best implemented country-wide during the following years.

5.1.1 Personnel management

MoEYS is one of the priority Ministries in the overall government reform process covering financial management and human resources management. MoEYS manages around 60% of civil servants. There remains a need to increase the staff establishment. The present restrictions on annual recruitment do not meet all agreed staffing norms. On the other hand, there are disparities in teacher distribution between urban and rural areas, especially disadvantaged areas.

5.1.1.1 Strategy

 Improve the standard of living of education staff by increasing remuneration, revising and rationalizing incentives, using bank transfers

 Review the demand and supply needs for teachers at national and sub-national levels and strengthen the procedures for staff transfer.

 Improve career path development by providing a clear career structure, merit based promotion and agreed salary scales.

 At least 10% of females hold position (from vice school principal up).

5.1.1.4 Program and activities

 Salary reform: increase basic salary to a minimum 400,000 riels. Increase other allowances such as extra hour allowance, two shift and double shift allowances. Increase salary for contracted teachers to 180,000 riels. Study the principles of salary and allowances for education staff. All education staff will receive salary through the banking system.

 Teacher need and supply: revise staffing norms (administrative and teaching staff). Review and revise principle of teacher deployment (existing and newly recruited teachers) and principle for staff transfer in municipalities and provinces, as well as across the municipal and provincial boundaries. Study on number of teachers needed per year.

 Staff performance appraisal: prepare and revise criteria for promotion of management staff and implement staff performance appraisal system.

 Career path development: Promote on grades and steps according to selection and seniority and automatically promote on grade for those with 2 years seniority. Organize internal examination to upgrade (A and B status). Disseminate and implement guideline on staff promotion. Organize and implement a credit rating system for education staff.

 Capacity development for education management staff: develop capacity programs for management and technical officials in various departments and for staff who are eligible to be managers and education mangers from school principal up to director general.

5.1.2 Teacher pre- and in-service training and capacity development for management level

5.1.2.1 Background

Teachers at pre-service level are trained by using a formula including short and long-term training based on projected need.

 Pre-school and primary school teachers are being trained for 2 years using formula 12+2. Candidates are being selected from students with or without grade 12 certificate and formula 9+2 for student with grade 9 certificate from rural and disadvantaged areas.

 Lower secondary teachers are being trained for 2 years using formula 12+2 and being selected from students with at least grade 12 certificate.

 Higher education teachers are being trained using formula bachelor + 1.

Teacher in-service trainings are conducted in three ways: the teacher in-service training on site (technical meeting is held every Thursday), unplanned and short-term teacher in-service training as required by MoEYS and organized teacher in-

service training (program plan is clearly defined at TTC). These trainings have not been clearly and systematically implemented.

5.1.2.2 Policy objectives

 Pre-service training for pre-school and primary school teachers using formula 9+2 will be replaced by 12+2 by selecting candidates with at least grade 12 certificate. Pre-service training for lower secondary school teachers will keep existing formula 12+2. Pre-service training for upper secondary school teachers will continue with formula bachelor +1.

 From 2020, pre-service training for pre-school, primary school, and lower secondary school teachers will follow formula 12+4 or bachelor +1. Pre-service training for higher education teachers will be changed from bachelor+1 to Master degree +1.

 From 2020, all newly recruited teacher holding at least bachelor degree.

5.1.2.3 Strategies

 Improve teacher training framework.

 Develop capacity of teachers.

 Develop capacity of trainers.

 Develop infrastructure for training and capacity development.

5.1.2.4 Policy actions

 Prepare a pre- and in-service teacher training system in 2015.

 Prepare a teacher training management and appraisal system in 2014.

5.1.2.5 Outcome indicators

 Percentage of trained teachers (12+2) at pre-school and primary school increases to 100% in 2018.

 Every year 5% of teachers at all level received in-service training from 2016.

5.1.2.6 Program and activities

 Development of pre-service training for teachers at all levels: pre-service training for pre-school and primary school teachers will be carried out following formula 12+2. Pre-service training for lower and upper secondary school teachers will follow the same formula. Training program and syllabus will be improved.

 Development of in-service training for teachers at all levels: prepare regular in-service plan to improve teacher capacity. 5 year after graduation from TTCs, teachers at all levels will receive in-service training at TTCs.
